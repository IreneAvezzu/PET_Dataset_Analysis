   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The MPON sents the dismissal to the MPOO. The MPOO reviews the dismissal. The MPOO opposes the dismissal of MPON or the MPOO confirmes the dismissal of the MPON..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's analyze the activities and their relationships:

1. **Activities**:
   - MPON sends dismissal to MPOO
   - MPOO reviews dismissal
   - MPOO opposes dismissal
   - MPOO confirms dismissal

2. **Simplified Activity Labels** for use in constraints:
   - send_dismissal
   - review_dismissal
   - oppose_dismissal
   - confirm_dismissal

Based on the process description:

- The process starts with **send_dismissal** (MPON sends the dismissal to the MPOO).
- Then, **review_dismissal** occurs (MPOO reviews the dismissal).
- After the review, there are two possible paths:
  - **oppose_dismissal** (MPOO opposes the dismissal of MPON)
  - or **confirm_dismissal** (MPOO confirms the dismissal of the MPON)

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Mandatory Occurrences and Order
- **send_dismissal** must occur first.
- **review_dismissal** must occur after **send_dismissal** and before either **oppose_dismissal** or **confirm_dismissal**.

### Constraints
1. **Init(send_dismissal)**: The process must start with sending the dismissal.
2. **Response(send_dismissal, review_dismissal)**: If a dismissal is sent, it must be reviewed.
3. **exclusive-choice(oppose_dismissal, confirm_dismissal)**: After review, either opposition or confirmation must occur, but not both.

## Final Formal Declarative Constraints

```
Init(send_dismissal)
Response(send_dismissal, review_dismissal)
exclusive-choice(oppose_dismissal, confirm_dismissal)
```

## Activities
Activities: send_dismissal, review_dismissal, oppose_dismissal, confirm_dismissal

The provided process description leads to these constraints, focusing on the mandatory start, the required review aftersending the dismissal, and the exclusive choice between opposing or confirming the dismissal after the review.

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The EC tells the INQ about the change of his master data. The INQ notifies the IP of the change. The IP checks whether the master data can be changed at the desired time. The IP confirmes the changes of the INQ or the IP rejectes the changes of the INQ..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- EC tells the INQ about the change of his master data: This involves activities like notification or communication butspecifically let's denote it as `notification_EC_INQ`.
- The INQ notifies the IP of the change: This can be denoted as `notification_INQ_IP`.
- The IP checks whether the master data can be changed at the desired time: Let's call this `check_IP`.
- The IP confirms the changes of the INQ: This can be denoted as `confirmation_IP_INQ`.
- The IP rejects the changes of the INQ: This can be denoted as `rejection_IP_INQ`.

So, the activities are: notification_EC_INQ, notification_INQ_IP, check_IP, confirmation_IP_INQ, rejection_IP_INQ.

Given the process description, we can derive the following constraints:

1. The process starts with `notification_EC_INQ`, implying `Init(notification_EC_INQ)`.
2. `notification_EC_INQ` is followed by `notification_INQ_IP`, implying `response(notification_EC_INQ, notification_INQ_IP)`.
3. After `notification_INQ_IP`, the IP checks, implying `response(notification_INQ_IP, check_IP)`.
4. The IP either confirms or rejects, but not both, implying `exclusive-choice(confirmation_IP_INQ, rejection_IP_INQ)`.
5. One of confirmation or rejection must happen after check_IP, implying `succession(check_IP, confirmation_IP_INQ)` and `succession(check_IP, rejection_IP_INQ)` or more accurately `choice(confirmation_IP_INQ, rejection_IP_INQ)` given the context that one must happen.

However, a more precise interpretation focusing on the essential flow:

- The process starts with `notification_EC_INQ` (`Init(notification_EC_INQ)`).
- Followed by `notification_INQ_IP` (`response(notification_EC_INQ, notification_INQ_IP)`).
- Then `check_IP` happens (`succession(notification_INQ_IP, check_IP)`).
- After `check_IP`, either `confirmation_IP_INQ` or `rejection_IP_INQ` occurs (`exclusive-choice(confirmation_IP_INQ, rejection_IP_INQ)`), and both are preceded by `check_IP` (`precedence(check_IP, confirmation_IP_INQ)` and `precedence(check_IP, rejection_IP_INQ)`).

But given the direct sequence and conditions:

## Temporary Declarative Constraints
- Init(notification_EC_INQ)
- response(notification_EC_INQ, notification_INQ_IP)
- succession(notification_INQ_IP, check_IP)
- precedence(check_IP, confirmation_IP_INQ)
- precedence(check_IP, rejection_IP_INQ)
- exclusive-choice(confirmation_IP_INQ, rejection_IP_INQ)

## Activities: notification_EC_INQ, notification_INQ_IP, check_IP, confirmation_IP_INQ, rejection_IP_INQ

## Final Formal Declarative Constraints
Init(notification_EC_INQ)
response(notification_EC_INQ, notification_INQ_IP)
succession(notification_INQ_IP, check_IP)
precedence(check_IP, confirmation_IP_INQ)
precedence(check_IP, rejection_IP_INQ)
exclusive-choice(confirmation_IP_INQ, rejection_IP_INQ)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and configures the software. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair is finished..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

1. **Check defect** (implied, not directly mentioned but necessary for understanding)
2. **Hand out repair cost calculation** (implied as part of the process)
3. **Decide on costs** (implied, customer decides)
4. **Check and repair hardware**
5. **Check and configure software**
6. **Test system functionality**
7. **Execute arbitrary repair activity** (for hardware or software)

For simplicity and clarity, let's directly map these to activities:

- **Check_defect**
- **Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation**
- **Decide_on_costs**
- **Check_and_repair_hardware**
- **Check_and_configure_software**
- **Test_system_functionality**
- **Execute_arbitrary_repair**

## Step 1: Understanding the Process Flow
The process starts with a customer bringing in a defective computer. The CRS then checks the defect and provides a repair cost calculation. The customer decides whether to proceed based on costs.

## Step 2: Identifying Key Constraints
1. **Existence of Activities**:
   - The process must include **Check_defect**, **Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation**, and **Decide_on_costs**.
   - If **Decide_on_costs** is positive, then both **Check_and_repair_hardware** and **Check_and_configure_software** must occur.

2. **Order and Succession**:
   - **Check_defect** and **Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation** must occur before **Decide_on_costs**.
   - **Decide_on_costs** must occur before **Check_and_repair_hardware** and **Check_and_configure_software** if the customer decides to proceed.

3. **Coexistence and Succession**:
   - **Check_and_repair_hardware** and **Check_and_configure_software** can occur in any order but must both occur if the repair proceeds.
   - **Test_system_functionality** must occur after each repair activity.

4. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If **Execute_arbitrary_repair** occurs, then **Test_system_functionality** must occur afterward.

## Step 3: Formalizing Constraints
Given the provided constraint templates, let's formalize:

- **Existence(Check_defect)**
- **Existence(Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation)**
- **Existence(Decide_on_costs)**
- **Succession(Decide_on_costs, Check_and_repair_hardware)**
- **Succession(Decide_on_costs, Check_and_configure_software)**
- **Coexistence(Check_and_repair_hardware, Check_and_configure_software)**
- **Response(Check_and_repair_hardware, Test_system_functionality)**
- **Response(Check_and_configure_software, Test_system_functionality)**
- **Not-Exclusive-Choice(Check_and_repair_hardware, Check_and_configure_software)**
- **Precedence(Check_defect, Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation)**
- **Precedence(Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation, Decide_on_costs)**

## Step 4: Simplifying and Finalizing Constraints
After considering implications:
- **Init(Check_defect)**
- **Existence(Check_defect)**
- **Existence(Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation)**
- **Existence(Decide_on_costs)**
- **Succession(Check_defect, Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation)**
- **Succession(Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation, Decide_on_costs)**
- **Response(Decide_on_costs, Check_and_repair_hardware)**
- **Response(Decide_on_costs, Check_and_configure_software)**
- **Coexistence(Check_and_repair_hardware, Check_and_configure_software)**
- **Response(Check_and_repair_hardware, Test_system_functionality)**
- **Response(Check_and_configure_software, Test_system_functionality)**

## Step 5: Output
**Activities: Check_defect, Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation, Decide_on_costs, Check_and_repair_hardware, Check_and_configure_software, Test_system_functionality, Execute_arbitrary_repair**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**
- Init(Check_defect)
- Existence(Check_defect)
- Existence(Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation)
- Existence(Decide_on_costs)
- Succession(Check_defect, Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation)
- Succession(Hand_out_repair_cost_calculation, Decide_on_costs)
- Response(Decide_on_costs, Check_and_repair_hardware)
- Response(Decide_on_costs, Check_and_configure_software)
- Coexistence(Check_and_repair_hardware, Check_and_configure_software)
- Response(Check_and_repair_hardware, Test_system_functionality)
- Response(Check_and_configure_software, Test_system_functionality)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The MPON reports the meter operation to the GO. The GO examines the application of the MPON. The GO rejects the application of the MPON or the GO confirmes the application of the MPON. The GO informs the MPOO about the registration confirmation of the MPON. The GO informs the MSPO about the registration confirmation of the MPON. The MPON and the MPOO perform the equipment acquisition and / or equipment changes. The MPON informs the GO about the failure of the entire process or the MPON informs the GO about the successful completion of the entire process. The GO informs the MPON about the failure of the overall transaction by deadline if after a maximum time limit no message of the MPON is present at the GO.If the MPON informs the GO about the failure of the entire process, the GO confirms the failure of the assignment to the MPON. If the MPON informs the GO about the successful completion of the overall process, the GO assigns the MPON. The GO confirms the assignment to the MPON. The GO informs the MPOO about the failure of the assignment of the MPON or the GO informs the MPOO about the assignment of the MPON. The GO informs the MSPO about the failure of the assignment of the MPON or the GO informs the MSPO about the assignment of the MPON. The GO informs the SP about the assignment of the MPON..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first list out the activities mentioned:

- MPON reports the meter operation to the GO
- GO examines the application of the MPON
- GO rejects the application of the MPON
- GO confirms the application of the MPON
- GO informs the MPOO about the registration confirmation of the MPON
- GO informs the MSPO about the registration confirmation of the MPON
- MPON and the MPOO perform the equipment acquisition and/or equipment changes
- MPON informs the GO about the failure of the entire process
- MPON informs the GO about the successful completion of the entire process
- GO informs the MPON about the failure of the overall transaction by deadline
- GO confirms the failure of the assignment to the MPON
- GO assigns the MPON
- GO confirms the assignment to the MPON
- GO informs the MPOO about the failure of the assignment of the MPON
- GO informs the MPOO about the assignment of the MPON
- GO informs the MSPO about the failure of the assignment of the MPON
- GO informs the MSPO about the assignment of the MPON
- GO informs the SP about the assignment of the MPON

Activities: MPON reports meter operation, GO examines application, GO rejects application, GO confirms application, GO informs MPOO, GO informs MSPO, equipment acquisition/changes, MPON informs GO about failure, MPON informs GO about success, GO informs MPON about failure, GO confirms failure, GO assigns MPON, GO confirms assignment, GO informs MPOO about failure/assignment, GO informs MSPO about failure/assignment, GO informs SP

## Step 1: Identify Key Activities and Their Relationships
The process involves several activities and conditional flows based on the success or failure of the process steps.

## 2: Determine the Constraints Based on Activity Relationships
- The process starts with "MPON reports the meter operation to the GO" implying **Init(MPON reports meter operation)**.
- "GO examines the application of the MPON" must happen after "MPON reports the meter operation to the GO", suggesting **precedence(MPON reports meter operation, GO examines application)**.
- "GO rejects the application of the MPON" and "GO confirms the application of the MPON" are alternatives after "GO examines the application of the MPON", suggesting **exclusive-choice(GO rejects application, GO confirms application)**.
- After "GO confirms the application of the MPON", the GO must inform both MPOO and MSPO, suggesting **succession(GO confirms application, GO informs MPOO)** and **succession(GO confirms application, GO informs MSPO)**.
- **response(MPON informs GO about success, GO assigns MPON)** and **response(MPON informs GO about failure, GO confirms failure)**.

## 3: Formalize the Constraints
Based on the process description and the identified relationships:

1. **Init(MPON reports meter operation)**
2. **precedence(MPON reports meter operation, GO examines application)**
3. **exclusive-choice(GO rejects application, GO confirms application)**
4. **succession(GO confirms application, GO informs MPOO)**
5. **succession(GO confirms application, GO informs MSPO)**
6. **response(MPON informs GO about success, GO assigns MPON)**
7. **response(MPON informs GO about failure, GO confirms failure)**
8. **not-co-existence(GO rejects application, GO confirms application)**
9. **succession(GO assigns MPON, GO confirms assignment)**
10. **response(MPON informs GO about failure, GO confirms failure of assignment)**
11. **succession(GO informs MPOO about registration confirmation, equipment acquisition/changes)**
12. **not-succession(GO informs MPON about failure, GO assigns MPON)**

## 4: Consider Implications and Simplify
Given the implications between constraints, we need to ensure that only the strongest (highest level) constraints are present.

The final answer is:
Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(MPON reports meter operation)
precedence(MPON reports meter operation, GO examines application)
exclusive-choice(GO rejects application, GO confirms application)
succession(GO confirms application, GO informs MPOO)
succession(GO confirms application, GO informs MSPO)
response(MPON informs GO about success, GO assigns MPON)
response(MPON informs GO about failure, GO confirms failure)
not-co-existence(GO rejects application, GO confirms application)
succession(GO assigns MPON, GO confirms assignment)
response(MPON informs GO about failure, GO confirms failure of assignment)
succession(GO informs MPOO about registration confirmation, equipment acquisition/changes)
not-succession(GO informs MPON about failure, GO assigns MPON)
Activities: MPON reports meter operation, GO examines application, GO rejects application, GO confirms application, GO informs MPOO, GO informs MSPO, equipment acquisition/changes, MPON informs GO about failure, MPON informs GO about success, GO informs MPON about failure, GO confirms failure, GO assigns MPON, GO confirms assignment, GO informs MPOO about failure/assignment, GO informs MSPO about failure/assignment, GO informs SP about assignment

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   Whenever a company makes the decision to go public, its first task is to select the underwriters. Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue. Usually they play a triple role : First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice, then they buy the issue, and finally they resell it to the public. Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly. Thus, in addition to handling the sale of a company â€™ s issue, the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it. They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to registering the issue with the SEC, they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state. While the registration statement is awaiting approval, underwriters begin to firm up the issue price. They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors. Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC, underwriters fix the issue price. After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public, when they haven â€™ t still found any reason not to do it..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesmentioned:

1. Select underwriters
2. Provide procedural and financial advice
3. Buy the issue
4. Resell the issue to the public
5. Prepare a registration statement
6. Register the issue with the SEC
7. Check compliance with blue-sky laws
8. Firm up the issue price
9. Arrange a road show
10. Receive clearance from the SEC
11. Fix the issue price
12. Enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock
13. Offer the stock to the public

Based on the description, we can derive the following constraints:

- The process starts with selecting underwriters, which implies **Init(select underwriters)**.
- Selecting underwriters is followed by providing procedural and financial advice, buying the issue, and reselling it, but these are more like a succession of tasks rather than strict sequences for all cases. However, we can infer:
  - **Succession(Select underwriters, Provide procedural and financial advice)**
  - **Succession(Provide procedural and financial advice, Buy the issue)**
  - **Succession(Buy the issue, Resell the issue to the public)**

- Preparing a registration statement, registering with the SEC, and checking compliance are related:
  - **Succession(Prepare a registration statement, Register the issue with the SEC)**
  - **Succession(Register the issue with the SEC, Check compliance with blue-sky laws)**

- The issue price is firmed up before receiving clearance from the SEC, and then fixed immediately after:
  - **Precedence(Receive clearance from the SEC, Fix the issue price)**
  - **Response(Firm up the issue price, Receive clearance from the SEC)**

- Arranging a road show happens before fixing the issue price, and it's reasonable to consider:
  - **Precedence(Arrange a road show, Fix the issue price)**

- Entering into a firm commitment to buy and offering to the public happens after fixing the issue price:
  - **Succession(Fix the issue price, Enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock)**
  - **Succession(Enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock, Offer the stock to the public)**

Given the implications between constraints, we need to ensure that only the strongest (highest level) constraints are present.

**Activities: select underwriters, provide procedural and financial advice, buy the issue, resell the issue to the public, prepare a registration statement, register the issue with the SEC, check compliance with blue-sky laws, firm up the issue price, arrange a road show, receive clearance from the SEC, fix the issue price, enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock, offer the stock to the public**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

1. Init(select underwriters)
2. Succession(select underwriters, provide procedural and financial advice)
3. Succession(provide procedural and financial advice, buy the issue)
4. Succession(buy the issue, resell the issue to the public)
5. Succession(prepare a registration statement, register the issue with the SEC)
6. Succession(register the issue with the SEC, check compliance with blue-sky laws)
7. Precedence(receive clearance from the SEC, fix the issue price)
8. Response(firm up the issue price, receive clearance from the SEC)
9. Precedence(arrange a road show, fix the issue price)
10. Succession(fix the issue price, enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock)
11. Succession(enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock, offer the stock to the public)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The process starts when a customer submits a claim by sending in relevant documentation. The Notification departmentat the car insurer checks the documents upon completeness and registers the claim. Then, the Handling department picks up the claim and checks the insurance. Then, an assessment is performed. If the assessment is positive, a garage is phoned to authorise the repairs and the payment is scheduled (in this order). Otherwise, the claim is rejected. In any case (whether the outcome is positive or negative), a letter is sent to the customer and the process is considered to be complete..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- submit_claim (customer submits a claim)
- check_documents (Notification department checks the documents)
- register_claim (Notification department registers the claim)
- pick_up_claim (Handling department picks up the claim)
- check_insurance (Handling department checks the insurance)
- perform_assessment (an assessment is performed)
- phone_garage (a garage is phoned to authorise the repairs)
- schedule_payment (the payment is scheduled)
- send_letter (a letter is sent to the customer)

Based on the process description, here are the steps and their implications for constraints:

1. The process starts with submitting a claim.
   - **Init(submit_claim)**

2. The Notification department checks and then registers the claim.
   - **Succession(submit_claim, check_documents)**
   - **Succession(check_documents, register_claim)**

3. Then, the Handling department picks up the claim and checks the insurance.
   - **Succession(register_claim, pick_up_claim)**
   - **Succession(pick_up_claim, check_insurance)**

4. An assessment is performed.
   - **Succession(check_insurance, perform_assessment)**

5. If the assessment is positive, a garage is phoned, and the payment is scheduled.
   - **Response(perform_assessment, phone_garage)**
   - **Succession(phone_garage, schedule_payment)**

6. A letter is sent to the customer in any case.
   - **Existence(send_letter)**
   - **Not-Exclusive-Choice(perform_assessment, send_letter)** seems implied but given the existence of **send_letter**regardless of the assessment, **not directly adding this but focus on assured constraints**

7. The process considers the outcome and completes.
   - Implies various endings but focus on assured direct sequences.

**Direct and Implied Constraints:**

- **Init(submit_claim)**
- **Succession(submit_claim, check_documents)**
- **Succession(check_documents, register_claim)**
- **Succession(register_claim, pick_up_claim)**
- **Succession(pick_up_claim, check_insurance)**
- **Succession(check_insurance, perform_assessment)**
- **Response(perform_assessment, phone_garage)**
- **Succession(perform_assessment, send_letter)**
- **Succession(phone_garage, schedule_payment)**
- **Existence(send_letter)**
- **Not-Response(perform_assessment, schedule_payment)** because payment only happens if assessment is positive.

**Activities: submit_claim, check_documents, register_claim, pick_up_claim, check_insurance, perform_assessment, phone_garage, schedule_payment, send_letter**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

- Init(submit_claim)
- Succession(submit_claim, check_documents)
- Succession(check_documents, register_claim)
- Succession(register_claim, pick_up_claim)
- Succession(pick_up_claim, check_insurance)
- Succession(check_insurance, perform_assessment)
- Response(perform_assessment, phone_garage)
- Succession(phone_garage, schedule_payment)
- Existence(send_letter)
- Not-Response(perform_assessment, schedule_payment)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The MPON notifies the MPOO about equipment change intentions. The MPOO announces self dismounting to the MPON or theMPOO shall notify the MPON about no self-dismounting of the MPOO. The MPON or the MPOO perform the final reading. The MPON or the MPOO dismount the old equipment. The MPON mounts the new device. The MPON reads the meter count from the installed meter. The MPON sents the values of the final reading to the GO. The MPON tells the GO about the device changes, the master data and the meter count at installation. The GO shall notify the MSP about the device changes, the master data, the meter count at dismounting, and the meter count at installation..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- MPON notifies MPOO about equipment change intentions
- MPOO announces self-dismounting to MPON
- MPON or MPOO perform final reading
- MPON or MPOO dismount old equipment
- MPON mounts new device
- MPON reads meter count from installed meter
- MPON sends values of final reading to GO
- MPON tells GO about device changes, master data, and meter count at installation
- GO notifies MSP about device changes, master data, meter count at dismounting, and meter count at installation

Let's denote these activities with simpler terms for clarity:
- notify_equipment_change
- announce_self_dismounting
- perform_final_reading
- dismount_old_equipment
- mount_new_device
- read_meter_count
- send_final_reading_values
- inform_GO_about_device_changes
- notify_MSP

Based on the process description, here are some initial observations:

1. **notify_equipment_change** must happen before **announce_self_dismounting** or **notify_MPON_about_no_self_dismounting** (not directly mentioned but implied). However, specific activities like **notify_MPON_about_no_self_dismounting** are not listed; we'll focus on given activities.

2. **perform_final_reading**, **dismount_old_equipment**, **mount_new_device**, **read_meter_count**, **send_final_reading_values**, and **inform_GO_about_device_changes** seem to follow in a sequence or conditionally.

Given the complexity and the need to adhere strictly to provided templates and constraints, let's analyze:

- **Succession(notify_equipment_change, perform_final_reading)**: The process starts with notifying equipment change intentions, followed by performing a final reading.

- **Succession(perform_final_reading, dismount_old_equipment)**: After final reading, the old equipment is dismounted.

- **Succession(dismount_old_equipment, mount_new_device)**: Dismounting old equipment precedes mounting new equipment.

- **Succession(mount_new_device, read_meter_count)**: Mounting new device precedes reading the meter count.

- **Succession(read_meter_count, send_final_reading_values)**: Reading meter count precedes sending final reading values.

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The MSPN registers the measurement at the GO. The GO examines the application of the MSPN. The GO rejects the application of the MSPN or the GO confirmes the application of the MSPN. The GO assigns the MSPN. The GO informs the MSPO about the assignment of MSPN. The GO informs the MPO about the assignment of the MSPN. The GO informs the SP about the assignment of MSPN..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- Registers_measurement
- Examines_application
- Rejects_application
- Confirms_application
- Assigns_MSPN
- Informs_MSPO
- Informs_MPO
- Informs_SP

From the process description, we can derive the following:

1. The process starts with "Registers_measurement" by MSPN, which implies **Init(Registers_measurement)**.

2. "Examines_application" happens after "Registers_measurement", implying **Response(Registers_measurement, Examines_application)**.

3. "Rejects_application" and "Confirms_application" are alternatives that follow "Examines_application", suggesting **Choice(Rejects_application, Confirms_application)** and implying that after "Examines_application", either "Rejects_application" or "Confirms_application" must occur, but not both, which can also imply **Exclusive-Choice(Rejects_application,Confirms_application)**.

4. "Assigns_MSPN" happens after either "Rejects_application" or "Confirms_application", implying **Response(Rejects_application, Assigns_MSPN)** and **Response(Confirms_application, Assigns_MSPN)**.

5. "Informs_MSPO", "Informs_MPO", and "Informs_SP" all happen after "Assigns_MSPN", suggesting **Response(Assigns_MSPN,Informs_MSPO)**, **Response(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MPO)**, and **Response(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_SP)**.

Given these observations and the implications between constraints, let's simplify and directly provide the final constraints, ensuring that we do not duplicate constraints that imply one another.

**Activities: Registers_measurement, Examines_application, Rejects_application, Confirms_application, Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MSPO, Informs_MPO, Informs_SP**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

- Init(Registers_measurement)
- Response(Registers_measurement, Examines_application)
- Exclusive-Choice(Rejects_application, Confirms_application)
- Response(Rejects_application, Assigns_MSPN)
- Response(Confirms_application, Assigns_MSPN)
- Response(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MSPO)
- Response(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MPO)
- Response(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_SP)
- Succession(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MSPO)
- Succession(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MPO)
- Succession(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_SP)

However, upon closer inspection and applying the implications:

- **Succession** implies **Co-Existence** and **Response**,
- **Exclusive-Choice** implies **Choice**,

and given the direct succession and response relationships, we can actually represent the process with a focus on the strongest implications:

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

- Init(Registers_measurement)
- Response(Registers_measurement, Examines_application)
- Exclusive-Choice(Rejects_application, Confirms_application)
- Response(Rejects_application, Assigns_MSPN)
- Response(Confirms_application, Assigns_MSPN)
- Succession(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MSPO)
- Succession(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MPO)
- Succession(Assigns_MSPN, Informs_SP)

**Activities: Registers_measurement, Examines_application, Rejects_application, Confirms_application, Assigns_MSPN, Informs_MSPO, Informs_MPO, Informs_SP**

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   Every weekday morning, the database is backed up and then it is checked to see whether the Account Defaulter table has new records. If no new records are found, then the process should check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed. If new returns exist, then register all defaulting accounts and customers. If the defaulting client codes have not been previously advised, produce another table of defaulting accounts and send to account management. All of this must be completed by 2 : 30 pm, if it is not, then an alert should be sent to the supervisor. Once the new defaultingaccount report has been completed, check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed. If new returns havebeen filed, reconcile with the existing account defaulters table. This must be completed by 4 : 0 pm otherwise a supervisor should be sent a message..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesmentioned:

1. Database backup
2. Check for new records in the Account Defaulter table
3. Check the CRM system for new returns
4. Register defaulting accounts and customers
5. Produce a table of defaulting accounts and send to account management
6. Send an alert to the supervisor (if process not completed by 2:30 pm)
7. Check the CRM system for new returns (after completing the new defaulting account report)
8. Reconcile with the existing account defaulters table (if new returns have been filed)

Based on the process description, here are the declarative constraints:

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The INQ transmits the transaction data request to the IP. The IP checks the request of the INQ. The IP answers the question of the INQ depending on the outcome of the examination, i.e. Transmission of data or rejection..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- INQ transmits the transaction data request to the IP (Let's call this activity "transmit_request")
- IP checks the request of the INQ (Let's call this activity "check_request")
- IP answers the question of the INQ (Let's call this activity "answer_question")

So, the activities are: transmit_request, check_request, answer_question

Now, let's analyze the process description to extract the constraints:

1. The process starts with "The INQ transmits the transaction data request to the IP." This implies that "transmit_request" must be the first event.

Constraint: Init(transmit_request)

2. The IP then checks the request, indicating that "check_request" must occur after "transmit_request".

Constraint: response(transmit_request, check_request)

3. Depending on the outcome, the IP answers, which means "answer_question" must occur after "check_request".

Constraint: response(check_request, answer_question)

However, there's a more straightforward interpretation directly from the text:

- The process implies that after the request is transmitted, it is checked, and then an answer is provided. This directly suggests a sequence.

Given the information and focusing on the provided constraint templates, we can observe:

- The sequence of events is: transmit_request -> check_request -> answer_question

This directly implies:

- succession(transmit_request, check_request)
- succession(check_request, answer_question)

And because these activities seem to always happen in this order without exception:

- precedence(transmit_request, check_request)
- precedence(check_request, answer_question)

Also, considering that for every request checked there seems to be an answer:

- responded-existence(check_request, answer_question)

But we need to focus on the strongest constraints that encompass these requirements.

## Step 1: Identify Activities
The activities involved are transmit_request, check_request, and answer_question.

## Step 2: Determine Sequence and Dependencies
The sequence given is transmit_request -> check_request -> answer_question.

## Step 3: Translate to Constraints
Based on the sequence:
- Init(transmit_request)
- succession(transmit_request, check_request)
- succession(check_request, answer_question)
- precedence(transmit_request, check_request)
- precedence(check_request, answer_question)
- response(transmit_request, check_request)
- response(check_request, answer_question)
- responded-existence(check_request, answer_question)

However, given the implications:
- response implies responded-existence
- succession implies response and precedence

## Step 4: Refine Constraints Based on Implications
The strongest constraints that cover the process description without redundancy, focusing on implications:

- Init(transmit_request)
- succession(transmit_request, check_request)
- succession(check_request, answer_question)

Activities: transmit_request, check_request, answer_question

## Step 5: Finalize Formal Declarative Constraints
Given the analysis, the final set of constraints, ensuring no redundancy and focusing on the strongest implications:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(transmit_request)
succession(transmit_request, check_request)
succession(check_request, answer_question)
Activities: transmit_request, check_request, answer_question

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The process is triggered by the demand of a functional department to fill a post. The post is advertised, applicantsapply, the applications are checked and the post is filled. The process finishes when the post was filled, precisely through the conclusion of a contract of employment..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- advertise_post
- apply
- check_applications
- fill_post
- conclude_contract

From the process description: "The process is triggered by the demand of a functional department to fill a post. The post is advertised, applicants apply, the applications are checked and the post is filled. The process finishes when the post was filled, precisely through the conclusion of a contract of employment."

We can infer the following logical sequence and relationships:

1. The process starts with a demand to fill a post, but this is not explicitly an activity in the list; however, it implies that "advertise_post" is the first significant activity.
2. "advertise_post" happens before "apply".
3. "apply" happens before "check_applications".
4. "check_applications" happens before "fill_post".
5. "fill_post" happens before "conclude_contract".

Based on these sequences, we can derive:

- precedence(advertise_post, apply)
- precedence(apply, check_applications)
- precedence(check_applications, fill_post)
- precedence(fill_post, conclude_contract)

Also, given that "conclude_contract" only happens after "fill_post" and the process finishes with "conclude_contract", it implies:

- response(fill_post, conclude_contract)

The existence of "conclude_contract" is mandatory for the process to finish, implying:

- existence(conclude_contract)

Given that "advertise_post" seems to be the starting point:

- Init(advertise_post)

Activities: advertise_post, apply, check_applications, fill_post, conclude_contract

Temporary Declarative Constraints:
- precedence(advertise_post, apply)
- precedence(apply, check_applications)
- precedence(check_applications, fill_post)
- precedence(fill_post, conclude_contract)
- response(fill_post, conclude_contract)
- existence(conclude_contract)
- Init(advertise_post)

However, to adhere strictly to the required format and to finalize:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
- Init(advertise_post)
- precedence(advertise_post, apply)
- precedence(apply, check_applications)
- precedence(check_applications, fill_post)
- precedence(fill_post, conclude_contract)
- response(fill_post, conclude_contract)
- existence(conclude_contract)

Activities: advertise_post, apply, check_applications, fill_post, conclude_contract

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded. A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO. At the customer service an employee enters (based on thereceived data) a problem report into system T.. Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are. Based on this, the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities. An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based oninformation that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship. In case the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra problem fix process (this process will not be detailed here). In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues. Taking together the information (i.e. contract commitment data+ prioritized actions) a detailed problem report is created. The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management. Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers. After receiving the detailed problem report, Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning. In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves, the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning. If Service Management is sure they can analyze it, they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a troublereport that indicates the type of problem. After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report, it is checked whether there are any possible problems. If no problems are detected, a notification about the normal service execution is created. If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created.Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to ServiceManagement. Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information. Subsequently ithas to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report. Three alternative process paths may be taken. For the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service. For the case that minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves. Subsequently, the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service. After sending, this process path of Service Management ends. For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required, Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration. This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning. Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out, otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process. After the restoration request is received, all possible errors are tracked. Based on the tracked errors, all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning. Then a trouble-shooting report is created. This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends. The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as describedfor ii). Customer Service either receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem resolution report. Then, two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e. i) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and ii) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing. The report for the customer is sent out to her. After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service. After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends..

   The process starts periodically on the first of each month, when Assembler AG places an order with the supplier in order to request more product parts. a) Assembler AG sends the order to the supplier. b) The supplier processes the order. c) The supplier sends an invoice to Assembler AG. d) Assembler AG receives the invoice..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- Placing an order
- Sending the order
- Processing the order
- Sending an invoice
- Receiving an invoice

Let's denote these activities as:
- place_order
- send_order
- process_order
- send_invoice
- receive_invoice

From the description:

1. The process starts periodically on the first of each month, when Assembler AG places an order with the supplier in order to request more product parts.
   - This implies **Init(place_order)**, as the process starts with placing an order.

2. a) Assembler AG sends the order to the supplier.
   - This is followed by the supplier's actions but directly implies **existence(send_order)** because sending the order must happen at least once.

3. b) The supplier processes the order.
   - **existence(process_order)** is implied because processing the order must occur.

4. c) The supplier sends an invoice to Assembler AG.
   - **existence(send_invoice)** is implied.

5. d) Assembler AG receives the invoice.
   - **existence(receive_invoice)** is implied.

6. The sequence of events suggests that **succession(send_order, process_order)**, because sending the order precedes processing it.

7. Similarly, **succession(process_order, send_invoice)**, as the order is processed before the invoice is sent.

8. And **succession(send_invoice, receive_invoice)**, because receiving the invoice follows sending it.

Given these implications and the provided constraint hierarchy:

- **Init(place_order)**
- **existence(send_order)**
- **existence(process_order)**
- **existence(send_invoice)**
- **existence(receive_invoice)**
- **succession(send_order, process_order)**
- **succession(process_order, send_invoice)**
- **succession(send_invoice, receive_invoice)**

Activities: place_order, send_order, process_order, send_invoice, receive_invoice


Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(place_order)
existence(send_order)
existence(process_order)
existence(send_invoice)
existence(receive_invoice)
succession(send_order, process_order)
succession(process_order, send_invoice)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   When a claim is received, it is first checked whether the claimant is insured by the organization. If not, the claimant is informed that the claim must be rejected. Otherwise, the severity of the claim is evaluated. Based on the outcome(simple or complex claims), relevant forms are sent to the claimant. Once the forms are returned, they are checked for completeness. If the forms provide all relevant details, the claim is registered in the Claims Management system, which ends the Claims Notification process. Otherwise, the claimant is informed to update the forms. Upon reception of the updated forms, they are checked again..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- receive_claim
- check_insurance
- inform_reject
- evaluate_severity
- send_forms
- return_forms
- check_completeness
- register_claim
- inform_update

Based on the process description, here are the steps and the corresponding constraints:

1. **receive_claim** is the starting point, but there's no specific constraint given for it being the first event in all traces (Init), so we focus on the logical flow.

2. The process checks if the claimant is insured. If not, it informs to reject and seemingly ends there for that path.

3. If insured, it evaluates severity, sends forms, and upon return, checks completeness.

4. If complete, it registers the claim. If not, it informs to update and checks again upon return.

From the description, the following constraints can be inferred:

- **Init(receive_claim)**: The process starts with receiving a claim.

- **response(check_insurance, inform_reject)**: If the claimant is not insured, then inform_reject occurs.

- **response(check_insurance, evaluate_severity)**: If the claimant is insured, then evaluate_severity occurs.

- **succession(evaluate_severity, send_forms)**: Evaluating severity leads to sending forms.

- **succession(send_forms, return_forms)**: Sending forms leads to their return.

- **succession(return_forms, check_completeness)**: Returning forms leads to checking their completeness.

- **response(check_completeness, register_claim)**: If the forms are complete, then register_claim occurs.

- **response(check_completeness, inform_update)**: If the forms are not complete, then inform_update occurs.

- **not-succession(inform_reject, evaluate_severity)**: inform_reject cannot be followed by evaluate_severity.

- **not-succession(inform_update, check_completeness)**: inform_update about updating forms should not directly precedeanother check_completeness without returning updated forms.

However, upon closer inspection and to adhere strictly to provided templates and process implications:

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

- Init(receive_claim)
- response(check_insurance, inform_reject)
- response(check_insurance, evaluate_severity)
- succession(evaluate_severity, send_forms)
- succession(send_forms, return_forms)
- succession(return_forms, check_completeness)
- response(check_completeness, register_claim)
- response(check_completeness, inform_update)
- not-succession(inform_reject, evaluate_severity)

**Activities: receive_claim, check_insurance, inform_reject, evaluate_severity, send_forms, return_forms, check_completeness, register_claim, inform_update**

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   Once the dates are finalized (by the Coordination Unit), the Support Officer updates all group calendars and createsmeeting folders for each meeting and ensures all appropriate documents are uploaded to system. Committee Members are advised a week before each meeting to read all related documents. The Committee Members hold their meeting, and the Support Office then produces minutes including any Action Points for each Committee Member. Within 5 working days, the Coordination Unit must conduct a QA check on the minutes, which are then sent to all Committee Members. The Support Officer then updates all departmental records..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- Finalize dates
- Update group calendars
- Create meeting folders
- Upload documents
- Advise Committee Members
- Hold meeting
- Produce minutes
- Conduct QA check
- Send minutes
- Update departmental records

The process description can be broken down into several steps, and from these, we can infer the following constraints:

1. **Init(finalize_dates)**: The process starts with finalizing dates.
2. **Succession(finalize_dates, update_group_calendars)**: Finalizing dates is followed by updating group calendars.
3. **Succession(update_group_calendars, create_meeting_folders)**: Updating group calendars is followed by creating meeting folders.
4. **Succession(create_meeting_folders, upload_documents)**: Creating meeting folders is followed by uploading documents.
5. **Response(advise_committee_members, hold_meeting)**: Advising Committee Members occurs before the meeting.
6. **Succession(hold_meeting, produce_minutes)**: The meeting is followed by producing minutes.
7. **Precedence(produce_minutes, conduct_qa_check)**: Conducting a QA check occurs after producing minutes.
8. **Response(produce_minutes, conduct_qa_check)**: Producing minutes implies conducting a QA check.
9. **Succession(conduct_qa_check, send_minutes)**: The QA check is followed by sending minutes.
10. **Succession(send_minutes, update_departmental_records)**: Sending minutes is followed by updating departmental records.
11. **Existence(finalize_dates)**: Finalizing dates must occur at least once.
12. **Existence(update_group_calendars)**: Updating group calendars must occur at least once.
13. **Existence(create_meeting_folders)**: Creating meeting folders must occur at least once.
14. **Existence(upload_documents)**: Uploading documents must occur at least once.
15. **Existence(advise_committee_members)**: Advising Committee Members must occur at least once.
16. **Existence(hold_meeting)**: Holding the meeting must occur at least once.
17. **Existence(produce_minutes)**: Producing minutes must occur at least once.
18. **Existence(conduct_qa_check)**: Conducting a QA check must occur at least once.
19. **Existence(send_minutes)**: Sending minutes must occur at least once.
20. **Existence(update_departmental_records)**: Updating departmental records must occur at least once.

However, upon analyzing the implications provided:

- The strongest constraints that imply others should be selected.

Given the process and constraints:

**Activities: finalize_dates, update_group_calendars, create_meeting_folders, upload_documents, advise_committee_members, hold_meeting, produce_minutes, conduct_qa_check, send_minutes, update_departmental_records**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

1. Init(finalize_dates)
2. Succession(finalize_dates, update_group_calendars)
3. Succession(update_group_calendars, create_meeting_folders)
4. Succession(create_meeting_folders, upload_documents)
5. Response(advise_committee_members, hold_meeting)
6. Succession(hold_meeting, produce_minutes)
7. Precedence(produce_minutes, conduct_qa_check)
8. Succession(conduct_qa_check, send_minutes)
9. Succession(send_minutes, update_departmental_records)
10. Existence(finalize_dates)
11. Existence(hold_meeting)
12. Existence(produce_minutes)
13. Existence(conduct_qa_check)

These constraints capture the essential flow and requirements of the process described, focusing on the mandatory sequences and existences without redundancy.

Note that some of the existence constraints for every single activity could potentially be implied or are stronger thanneeded given the succession and response constraints provided. However, given the direct description, ensuring each step happens is crucial. Adjustments might be necessary based on a deeper analysis of process implications and dependencies.

The selection here directly translates from the process description into formal declarative constraints, ensuring that the process flows as intended while adhering to the specified format and implications.

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   In November of each year, the Coordination Unit at the Town Planning Authority drafts a schedule of meetings for thenext calendar year and adds draft dates to all calendars. The Support Officer then checks the dates and suggests modifications. The Coordination Unit then rechecks all dates and looks for potential conflicts. The final schedule of meeting dates is sent to all the independent Committee Members by email, who then check their diaries and advise the Coordination Unit of any conflicts..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- drafting_schedule
- adding_draft_dates
- checking_dates
- suggesting_modifications
- rechecking_dates
- looking_for_conflicts
- sending_schedule
- checking_diaries
- advising_conflicts

Based on the process description, here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **drafting_schedule** and **adding_draft_dates** happen first.
2. Then, **checking_dates** and **suggesting_modifications**.
3. The Coordination Unit does **rechecking_dates** and **looking_for_conflicts**.
4. After that, **sending_schedule**.
5. Upon receiving the schedule, Committee Members do **checking_diaries** and **advising_conflicts**.

From this, we can derive the following constraints:

- **succession(drafting_schedule, adding_draft_dates)**: drafting_schedule occurs before adding_draft_dates.
- **succession(checking_dates, suggesting_modifications)**: checking_dates occurs before suggesting_modifications.
- **succession(rechecking_dates, looking_for_conflicts)**: rechecking_dates occurs before looking_for_conflicts.
- **succession(sending_schedule, checking_diaries)**: sending_schedule occurs before checking_diaries.
- **succession(checking_diaries, advising_conflicts)**: checking_diaries occurs before advising_conflicts.
- **response(rechecking_dates, looking_for_conflicts)**: If rechecking_dates occurs, then looking_for_conflicts occurs.
- **response(drafting_schedule, adding_draft_dates)**: If drafting_schedule occurs, then adding_draft_dates occurs.
- **response(checking_dates, suggesting_modifications)**: If checking_dates occurs, then suggesting_modifications occurs.
- **response(sending_schedule, checking_diaries)**: If sending_schedule occurs, then checking_diaries occurs.

However, we need to consider the implications and ensure we only have the strongest (highest level) constraints.

## Step 1: List Activities
Activities: drafting_schedule, adding_draft_dates, checking_dates, suggesting_modifications, rechecking_dates, looking_for_conflicts, sending_schedule, checking_diaries, advising_conflicts

## Step 2: Determine Constraints
Given the process and activities, let's finalize the constraints focusing on the essential ones that capture the process flow without redundancy.

## Step 3: Apply Implications
Ensure that if a constraint implies another, only the stronger one is kept.

The final answer is:
Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
succession(drafting_schedule, adding_draft_dates)
succession(checking_dates, suggesting_modifications)
succession(rechecking_dates, looking_for_conflicts)
succession(sending_schedule, checking_diaries)
succession(checking_diaries, advising_conflicts)
response(rechecking_dates, looking_for_conflicts)
response(drafting_schedule, adding_draft_dates)
response(checking_dates, suggesting_modifications)
response(sending_schedule, checking_diaries)
Activities: drafting_schedule, adding_draft_dates, checking_dates, suggesting_modifications, rechecking_dates, looking_for_conflicts, sending_schedule, checking_diaries, advising_conflicts

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   First, the Manager checks the open leads. Afterwards, he selects the top five ones. He then tells his Sales Assistant to call the contact person of the leads. The Sales Assistant calls each customer. If someone is interested, he sends anote to the Manager. The Manager then processes the lead. Otherwise, he calls the next customer..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- Manager checks open leads
- Manager selects top five leads
- Manager tells Sales Assistant to call contact persons
- Sales Assistant calls customers
- Customer is interested and sends a note to the Manager
- Manager processes the lead
- Manager calls the next customer

We can simplify these activities for use in constraints:

1. Check_open_leads
2. Select_top_leads
3. Instruct_Sales_Assistant
4. Call_customers
5. Send_note
6. Process_lead
7. Call_next_customer

Based on the process description, here are the declarative constraints:

- The process starts with the Manager checking open leads, so:
  Init(Check_open_leads)

- After checking open leads, the Manager selects top leads, implying:
  Response(Check_open_leads, Select_top_leads)

- The Manager then instructs the Sales Assistant to call the customers, implying:
  Response(Select_top_leads, Instruct_Sales_Assistant)

- The Sales Assistant calls customers after being instructed, implying:
  Response(Instruct_Sales_Assistant, Call_customers)

- If a customer is interested and sends a note, the Manager processes the lead, implying:
  Response(Send_note, Process_lead)

- The Manager calls the next customer if the previous customer is not interested. This doesn't directly imply a constraint but suggests that Call_next_customer happens under certain conditions.

- Existence of Process_lead because it must happen at least once for interested customers:
  Existence(Process_lead)

- Not-co-existence(Call_customers, Process_lead) because calling customers and processing leads don't happen together.

- Not-response(Call_customers, Process_lead) and Not-response(Send_note, Call_next_customer) because calling customers doesn't directly lead to processing leads without a note being sent, and sending a note doesn't lead to calling the nextcustomer.

However, to accurately reflect the process and given constraints, let's re-evaluate focusing on provided templates and implications:

## Step 1: Identify Key Activities and Their Relationships
The activities and their sequence provide a basis for constraints.

## Step 2: Apply Constraints
- Init(Check_open_leads)
- Response(Check_open_leads, Select_top_leads)
- Response(Select_top_leads, Instruct_Sales_Assistant)
- Response(Instruct_Sales_Assistant, Call_customers)
- Response(Send_note, Process_lead)
- Existence(Process_lead)

## Step 3: Consider Implications and Remove Redundant Constraints
Given implications, ensure only the strongest (highest-level) constraints are kept.

## Step 4: Formulate Final Constraints
Based on the process and implications:

Activities: Check_open_leads, Select_top_leads, Instruct_Sales_Assistant, Call_customers, Send_note, Process_lead, Call_next_customer

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(Check_open_leads)
Response(Check_open_leads, Select_top_leads)
Response(Select_top_leads, Instruct_Sales_Assistant)
Response(Instruct_Sales_Assistant, Call_customers)
Response(Send_note, Process_lead)
Existence(Process_lead)
Not-co-existence(Call_customers, Process_lead)
Response(Call_customers, Call_next_customer)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   I am the HR clerk. When a vacancy is reported to me, I create a job description from the information. Sometimes there is still confusion in the message, then I must ask the Department again. I am submitting the job description for consideration and waiting for the approval. But, it can also happen that the department does not approve it, but rejects it, and requests a correction. Then I correct the description and submit it again for consideration. If the description is finally approved, I post the job..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- create_job_description
- ask_Department
- submit_for_consideration
- approval
- reject
- correct_description
- post_job

From the process description, we can derive the following:

1. The process starts with creating a job description, which implies **Init(create_job_description)**.

2. If there's confusion, the HR clerk must ask the Department again, but this doesn't directly translate to a constraint without understanding the sequence.

3. The job description is submitted for consideration, and then there's a wait for approval.

4. If rejected, the description is corrected and submitted again.

5. If approved, the job is posted.

Based on these steps, here are some initial constraints:

- **Init(create_job_description)**: The process starts with creating a job description.

- **Response(create_job_description, submit_for_consideration)**: If a job description is created, it must be submittedfor consideration.

- **Precedence(submit_for_consideration, approval)**: Approval can only happen after submission for consideration.

- **Not-Response(approval, post_job)**: If approval happens, post_job must not happen afterward without approval.

- **Response(reject, correct_description)**: If the job description is rejected, it must be corrected.

- **Succession(approval, post_job)**: If there's an approval, then the job must be posted.

- **Alternate-Succession(reject, correct_description)**: Between any two rejections, there must be a correction.

However, let's refine and simplify based on the template and implications:

**Temporary Declarative Constraints:**

- Init(create_job_description)
- Response(create_job_description, submit_for_consideration)
- Precedence(submit_for_consideration, approval)
- Response(reject, correct_description)
- Succession(approval, post_job)
- Alternate-Succession(reject, correct_description)

Given the implications:
- Chain-Succession implies Chain-Response
- Chain-Response implies Alternate-Response
- Alternate-Response implies Response
- Response implies Responded-Existence

And other implications, we focus on the strongest constraints that aren't implied by others:

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

- Init(create_job_description)
- Response(create_job_description, submit_for_consideration)
- Precedence(submit_for_consideration, approval)
- Response(reject, correct_description)
- Succession(approval, post_job)
- Alternate-Succession(reject, correct_description)

**Activities:** create_job_description, ask_Department, submit_for_consideration, approval, reject, correct_description, post_job

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   If the MPOO sends the bill for the temporary continuation of the metering point operations to the GO, the GO examines the bill. If the MSPO sends the bill for the temporary continuation of the measurement to the GO, the GO examines the bill. If the MSPO sends the bill for additional readings to the GO, the GO examines the bill. If the MPOO sends the billfor the equipment acquisition to the MPON or the GO, the MPON or the GO examines the bill. The GO or the MPON confirms the invoice with payment advice to the MPOO or the MSPO, or the GO or the MPON rejects the invoice of the MPOO or the MSPO..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- Sending the bill for the temporary continuation of the metering point operations to the GO (or similar actions)
- Examining the bill
- Confirming the invoice with payment advice
- Rejecting the invoice

Let's denote these activities with more concise labels for simplicity:
- send_bill
- examine_bill
- confirm_invoice
- reject_invoice

## Step 1: Identify Activities and Their Relations
From the description, we can observe the following relations:
- If a bill is sent, it is examined.
- The examination of the bill does not necessarily lead to a confirmation or rejection immediately, but these actions are possible outcomes.
- Confirmation or rejection of the invoice can happen after the bill is examined.

## Step 2: Determine Constraints
Based on the process description:
1. **Response**: If send_bill occurs, then examine_bill occurs.
   - Template: response(send_bill, examine_bill)

2. **Co-Existence or Succession**: Although not directly stated, we can infer that examine_bill and either confirm_invoice or reject_invoice are related but do not directly succeed each other in a strict manner. However, we can say:
   - **Succession**: If examine_bill occurs, then either confirm_invoice or reject_invoice must occur.
     - However, given the template constraints, we'll focus on direct implications.

3. **Exclusive-Choice**: For the actions following examine_bill (confirm_invoice or reject_invoice), it seems like an exclusive choice:
   - **Exclusive-Choice**: confirm_invoice or reject_invoice.

## 3: Refine Constraints Based on Templates
Given the provided templates and the goal to minimize constraints while maximizing information:
- **Response**: response(send_bill, examine_bill)
- **Exclusive-Choice**: exclusive-choice(confirm_invoice, reject_invoice)

## 4: Consider Implied Constraints
Given the implications:
- No additional constraints are directly implied that aren't already considered.

## 5: List Activities and Constraints
**Activities:** send_bill, examine_bill, confirm_invoice, reject_invoice

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**
- response(send_bill, examine_bill)
- exclusive-choice(confirm_invoice, reject_invoice)

The answer is Activities: send_bill, examine_bill, confirm_invoice, reject_invoice
Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
- response(send_bill, examine_bill)
- exclusive-choice(confirm_invoice, reject_invoice)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   I am the Head of the functional department. When I have detected a number of personnel requirements, I report the vacancy to the Personnel Department. Then I wait to get the job description for review before it is advertized. Under certain circumstances, I must ask for corrections again, otherwise I approve the job description. Sometimes it also happens that the colleague from the HR department still has questions about the tasks and requirements before he can describe the job. Then I am available for clarifications, of course..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

1. Report vacancy to the Personnel Department
2. Get job description for review
3. Advertise the job
4. Ask for corrections
5. Approve the job description
6. Clarify tasks and requirements

Let's denote these activities as:
- report_vacancy
- get_job_description
- advertise_job
- ask_for_corrections
- approve_job_description
- clarify_tasks

From the description:

1. The process starts with reporting a vacancy to the Personnel Department.
   - Init(report_vacancy)

2. After reporting the vacancy, the Head of the department waits to get the job description for review.
   - Succession(report_vacancy, get_job_description)

3. The job description needs to be reviewed before it is advertised.
   - Response(get_job_description, advertise_job)

4. Under certain circumstances, corrections are asked for again before approving the job description.
   - Response(get_job_description, ask_for_corrections)

5. If corrections are not needed or have been addressed, the job description is approved.
   - Response(ask_for_corrections, approve_job_description) or
     - Response(get_job_description, approve_job_description) considering the path without corrections

6. Sometimes, clarifications about tasks and requirements are needed before describing the job.
   - Not directly stated but implies that clarify_tasks can happen before get_job_description.

Given these points, let's derive the constraints:

- Init(report_vacancy)
- Succession(report_vacancy, get_job_description)
- Response(get_job_description, advertise_job)
- Response(get_job_description, ask_for_corrections)
- Response(ask_for_corrections, approve_job_description)
- Not-Chain-Succession(report_vacancy, get_job_description) is not directly needed as succession is specified.

However, upon closer inspection and simplification considering the implications:

- Init(report_vacancy)
- Succession(report_vacancy, get_job_description)
- Response(get_job_description, advertise_job)
- Precedence(get_job_description, approve_job_description)
- Not-Exclusive-Choice(ask_for_corrections, approve_job_description) seems to fit as either corrections are asked or approval happens.

But given the implications and focusing on the strongest constraints:

**Temporary Declarative Constraints:**
- Init(report_vacancy)
- Succession(report_vacancy, get_job_description)
- Response(get_job_description, advertise_job)
- Precedence(get_job_description, approve_job_description)

**Activities: report_vacancy, get_job_description, advertise_job, ask_for_corrections, approve_job_description, clarify_tasks**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**
- Init(report_vacancy)
- Succession(report_vacancy, get_job_description)
- Response(get_job_description, advertise_job)
- Precedence(get_job_description, approve_job_description)
- Not-Exclusive-Choice(ask_for_corrections, approve_job_description)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   Every time we get a new order from the sales department, first, one of my masters determines the necessary parts andquantities as well as the delivery date. Once that information is present, it has to be entered into our production planning system (PPS). It optimizes our production processes and creates possibly uniform work packages so that the setup times are minimized. Besides, it creates a list of parts to be procured. Unfortunately it is not coupled correctly to ourEnterprise Resource Planning system (ERP), so the data must be transferred manually. By the way, that is the second step. Once all the data is present, we need to decide whether any parts are missing and must be procured or if this is not necessary. Once production is scheduled to start, we receive a notice from the system and an employee takes care of the implementation. Finally, the order will be checked again for its quality..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesmentioned:

1. Determining necessary parts and quantities as well as the delivery date.
2. Entering data into the production planning system (PPS).
3. Deciding whether parts are missing and must be procured.
4. Scheduling production to start.
5. Implementing the order.
6. Checking the order for quality.

Let's label these activities for clarity:

- Determine Parts (A)
- Enter PPS (B)
- Decide Procurement (C)
- Schedule Production (D)
- Implement Order (E)
- Quality Check (F)

From the process description:

1. The process starts with determining the necessary parts and quantities, etc. (A).
2. Then, data is entered into PPS (B).
3. After that, a decision is made on procurement (C).
4. Once production is scheduled to start (D), an employee implements the order (E).
5. Finally, the order is checked for quality (F).

## Step 1: Identify the Initial Activity
The process starts with "one of my masters determines the necessary parts and quantities as well as the delivery date,"which implies **Init(Determine Parts)**.

## Step 2: Identify Successive Activities
- **Succession(Determine Parts, Enter PPS)**: Determine Parts must be followed by Enter PPS.
- **Succession(Enter PPS, Decide Procurement)**: Enter PPS must be followed by Decide Procurement.

## 3: Analyze Constraints for Procurement Decision and Production Scheduling
- **Response(Decide Procurement, Schedule Production)**: Decide Procurement must be followed by Schedule Production.

## 4: Implementation and Quality Check
- **Succession(Schedule Production, Implement Order)**: Schedule Production must be followed by Implement Order.
- **Succession(Implement Order, Quality Check)**: Implement Order must be followed by Quality Check.

## 5: Other Constraints
- **Existence(Determine Parts)**: Determine Parts must occur at least once.
- **Existence(Enter PPS)**: Enter PPS must occur at least once.
- **Existence(Decide Procurement)**: Decide Procurement must occur at least once.
- **Existence(Schedule Production)**: Schedule Production must occur at least once.
- **Existence(Implement Order)**: Implement Order must occur at least once.
- **Existence(Quality Check)**: Quality Check must occur at least once.

## 6: Apply Implications
Given the implications:
- Succession implies Co-Existence, Response, and Precedence.
- Existence and other constraints might be implied by stronger constraints.

The final answer is:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(Determine Parts)
Succession(Determine Parts, Enter PPS)
Succession(Enter PPS, Decide Procurement)
Response(Decide Procurement, Schedule Production)
Succession(Schedule Production, Implement Order)
Succession(Implement Order, Quality Check)
Existence(Determine Parts)
Existence(Enter PPS)
Existence(Decide Procurement)
Existence(Schedule Production)
Existence(Implement Order)
Existence(Quality Check)
Activities: Determine Parts, Enter PPS, Decide Procurement, Schedule Production, Implement Order, Quality Check

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The MSPN sents a dismissal to the MSPO. The MSPO reviews the dismissal. The MSPO rejects the dismissal of the MSPN or The MSPO confirms the dismissal of the MSPN..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- MSPN sends dismissal
- MSPO reviews dismissal
- MSPO rejects dismissal
- MSPO confirms dismissal

Activities: sends_dismissal, reviews_dismissal, rejects_dismissal, confirms_dismissal

From the process description, we can derive the following:

1. The process starts with "MSPN sends dismissal," which implies that "sends_dismissal" must be the first event.
   - Init(sends_dismissal)

2. "MSPO reviews dismissal" must occur after "MSPN sends dismissal."
   - Precedence(sends_dismissal, reviews_dismissal)

3. After "MSPO reviews dismissal," there are two possible outcomes: "MSPO rejects dismissal" or "MSPO confirms dismissal." This indicates that "reviews_dismissal" must happen before both "rejects_dismissal" and "confirms_dismissal," but itdoes not specify that one must follow the other directly.
   - Response(reviews_dismissal, rejects_dismissal)
   - Response(reviews_dismissal, confirms_dismissal)

4. It is a choice between rejecting or confirming the dismissal after review, implying that at least one of them must occur after the review.
   - Choice(rejects_dismissal, confirms_dismissal)

5. Given that "MSPO reviews dismissal" must happen before either "MSPO rejects dismissal" or "MSPO confirms dismissal,"and considering that one of the two outcomes must occur, we also understand that:
   - Succession(reviews_dismissal, rejects_dismissal)
   - Succession(reviews_dismissal, confirms_dismissal)

However, upon closer inspection and applying the implications:

- Succession implies Co-Existence
- Succession implies Response
- Response implies Responded-Existence

The strongest, non-redundant constraints that cover the process description would focus on the essential relationships:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(sends_dismissal)
Precedence(sends_dismissal, reviews_dismissal)
Response(reviews_dismissal, rejects_dismissal)
Response(reviews_dismissal, confirms_dismissal)
Choice(rejects_dismissal, confirms_dismissal)

Activities: sends_dismissal, reviews_dismissal, rejects_dismissal, confirms_dismissal

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The SP / PU / GO request changes to the MPO or the MPO himself causes a change. The MPO reviews the change request. The MPO rejects the change of the measuring point by the SP / PU / GO or the MPO confirmes the request of the SP / PU / GO. The MPO performs the measuring point change. The MPO reports the implementation to the SP / PU / GO or notifies the SP / PU / GO about the failure of the changes..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- Request changes (SP / PU / GO or MPO)
- Review change request (MPO)
- Reject change (MPO)
- Confirm request (MPO)
- Perform measuring point change (MPO)
- Report implementation (MPO)
- Notify failure (MPO)

Activities: request changes, review change request, reject change, confirm request, perform measuring point change, report implementation, notify failure

Now, let's break down the process description into declarative constraints:

1. The process starts with a request for changes.
   - Init(request changes)

2. The MPO reviews the change request.
   - Response(request changes, review change request)

3. The MPO either rejects the change or confirms the request.
   - Exclusive-Choice(reject change, confirm request)
   - Response(review change request, reject change)
   - Response(review change request, confirm request)

4. If the MPO confirms the request, then the MPO performs the measuring point change.
   - Response(confirm request, perform measuring point change)

5. If the MPO rejects the change, then the process ends without performing the measuring point change.
   - Not-Response(reject change, perform measuring point change)

6. After performing the measuring point change, the MPO reports the implementation or notifies about the failure.
   - Succession(perform measuring point change, report implementation)
   - Succession(perform measuring point change, notify failure)
   - Exclusive-Choice(report implementation, notify failure)

7. Ensure that if there's a report or notification, it follows the change and is one of the two outcomes.
   - Chain-Succession(perform measuring point change, report implementation)
   - Chain-Succession(perform measuring point change, notify failure)

However, upon analyzing the implications and the process:

- Chain-Succession(perform measuring point change, report implementation)
- Chain-Succession(perform measuring point change, notify failure)
- Response(request changes, review change request)
- Exclusive-Choice(reject change, confirm request)
- Response(review change request, reject change)
- Response(review change request, confirm request)
- Response(confirm request, perform measuring point change)
- Not-Response(reject change, perform measuring point change)
- Init(request changes)
- Succession(perform measuring point change, report implementation)
- Succession(perform measuring point change, notify failure)
- Exclusive-Choice(report implementation, notify failure)

Can be reduced considering implications:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(request changes)
Response(request changes, review change request)
Exclusive-Choice(reject change, confirm request)
Response(review change request, reject change)
Response(review change request, confirm request)
Response(confirm request, perform measuring point change)
Not-Response(reject change, perform measuring point change)
Chain-Succession(perform measuring point change, report implementation)
Chain-Succession(perform measuring point change, notify failure)
Exclusive-Choice(report implementation, notify failure)
Activities: request changes, review change request, reject change, confirm request, perform measuring point change, report implementation, notify failure

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel. When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian, the room-service manager takes down the order. She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food. She also gives an order to the sommelier (i.e., the wine waiter) to fetch wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages. Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage. Finally, she assigns the order to the waiter. While the kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks, the waiter readies a cart (i.e., puts a tablecloth on the cart and gathers silverware). The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks. Once the food, wine, and cart are ready, the waiter delivers it to the guest â€™ s room. After returning to the room-service station, the waiter debits the guest â€™ s account. The waiter may wait to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- take_down_order
- submit_order_ticket
- give_order_to_sommelier
- assign_order_to_waiter
- ready_cart
- deliver_to_guest
- debit_guest_account

Based on the process description, we can derive the following constraints:

1. **Init(take_down_order)**: The process starts with taking down the order.
2. **Succession(take_down_order, submit_order_ticket)**: After taking down the order, submitting an order ticket to thekitchen must happen.
3. **Succession(take_down_order, give_order_to_sommelier)**: Giving an order to the sommelier happens after taking downthe order.
4. **Response(submit_order_ticket, ready_cart)**: If an order ticket is submitted, then the waiter readies a cart.
5. **Response(give_order_to_sommelier, ready_cart)**: If an order is given to the sommelier, then the waiter readies a cart.
6. **Precedence(ready_cart, deliver_to_guest)**: The cart must be ready before delivering to the guest.
7. **Succession(deliver_to_guest, debit_guest_account)**: After delivering to the guest, debiting the guest's account must happen.
8. **Not-Chain-Response(ready_cart, debit_guest_account)**: Debiting the guest's account must not happen immediately after readying the cart.

However, upon closer inspection and applying the implications:

- **Init(take_down_order)** implies some level of **Precedence** and **Response** constraints but is more fundamental.
- **Succession** and **Response** constraints are interrelated.

Given the process and focusing on the essential constraints without redundancy:

**Activities: take_down_order, submit_order_ticket, give_order_to_sommelier, assign_order_to_waiter, ready_cart, deliver_to_guest, debit_guest_account**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

1. Init(take_down_order)
2. Succession(take_down_order, submit_order_ticket)
3. Succession(take_down_order, give_order_to_sommelier)
4. Response(submit_order_ticket, ready_cart)
5. Response(give_order_to_sommelier, ready_cart)
6. Precedence(ready_cart, deliver_to_guest)
7. Succession(deliver_to_guest, debit_guest_account)
8. Not-Chain-Response(ready_cart, debit_guest_account)

This set captures the essential flow and relationships described in the process, focusing on the mandatory sequences and responses without redundancy.

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The process is initiated by a switch-over request. In doing so, the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company. Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution. The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system. After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility. In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list. The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times. In case the customerdoes not exist in the customer data base, a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow. This object consists of data elements such as the customers name and address and the assigned power gauge. The generated customer object is then used, in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch (including data such as bank connection, information on the selected rate, requested date of switch-over). In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS (customer information system) in order to confirm their successful generation. In case of a negative response, i.e. the contract documents are not (or incorrectly) generated, the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved. Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again. In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed. A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS. It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future. The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence, and the grid operator transmits a response comment. In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict. The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier (i.e. the customer service (of the new supplier) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination). If there are not any objections by thegrid operator (i.e. no supplier concurrence), customer service creates a CIS contract. The customer then has the chanceto check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirmit. Depending on the customers acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends (in case of withdrawal) or continues (in case of a confirmation). An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues.The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary (as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way) but it can speed up the switch process. On the switch-date, but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun, the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report. At the same time, the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier. Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer. For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then. After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information. The process of winning a new customer ends here..

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The process of an Office Supply Request starts when any employee of the organization submits an office supply request. Once the requirement is registered, the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the office supplies. The supervisor must approve or ask for a change, or reject the request. If the request is rejected the process will end. If the request is asked to make a change then it is returned to the petitioner / employee who can review the comments for the change request. If the request is approved it will go to the purchase department that will be in charge of making quotations (using a subprocess) and select a vendor. If the vendor is not valid in the system the purchase department will have to choose a different vendor. After a vendor is selected and confirmed, the system will generate and send a purchase order and wait for the product to be delivered and the invoice received. In any case the systemwill send a notification to let the user know what the result was. In any of the cases, approval, rejection or change required the system will send the user a notification..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesmentioned:

- Submit office supply request
- Receive request
- Approve
- Ask for change
- Reject
- Make quotation
- Select vendor
- Confirm vendor
- Generate purchase order
- Send purchase order
- Deliver product
- Receive invoice
- Send notification

Based on the process description, here are the declarative constraints:

### Temporary Declarative Constraints

- succession(Submit office supply request, Receive request)
- response(Receive request, Approve)
- response(Receive request, Ask for change)
- response(Receive request, Reject)
- not-succession(Reject, any activity except Send notification)
- response(Ask for change, Make quotation is not directly mentioned but implied in the subprocess)
- precedence(Approve, Make quotation)
- succession(Make quotation, Select vendor)
- response(Select vendor, Confirm vendor)
- succession(Confirm vendor, Generate purchase order)
- succession(Generate purchase order, Send purchase order)
- succession(Send purchase order, Deliver product)
- succession(Deliver product, Receive invoice)
- response(Approve, Send notification)
- response(Reject, Send notification)
- response(Ask for change, Send notification)
- existence(Send notification)

### Implications and Final Constraints

Given the implications:
- Chain-Succession implies Chain-Response
- Chain-Response implies Alternate-Response
- Alternate-Response implies Response
- Response implies Responded-Existence

And other implications, we prioritize the stronger constraints:

### Final Formal Declarative Constraints

- succession(Submit office supply request, Receive request)
- response(Receive request, Approve)
- response(Receive request, Ask for change)
- response(Receive request, Reject)
- not-succession(Reject, any activity except Send notification)
- precedence(Approve, Make quotation)
- succession(Make quotation, Select vendor)
- response(Select vendor, Confirm vendor)
- succession(Confirm vendor, Generate purchase order)
- succession(Generate purchase order, Send purchase order)
- succession(Send purchase order, Deliver product)
- succession(Deliver product, Receive invoice)
- response(Approve, Send notification)
- response(Reject, Send notification)
- response(Ask for change, Send notification)
- existence(Send notification)
- not-co-existence(Reject, Approve)
- not-co-existence(Reject, Ask for change)
- not-succession(Approve, Ask for change)

### Activities
Activities: Submit office supply request, Receive request, Approve, Ask for change, Reject, Make quotation, Select vendor, Confirm vendor, Generate purchase order, Send purchase order, Deliver product, Receive invoice, Send notification

The final formal declarative constraints are provided directly above, ensuring that the process adheres to the described behavior without explicitly mentioning subprocesses like quotation but capturing the essential flow and decisions.

   The MSPO deregisters at the GO. The GO verifies the deregistration. The GO rejects the deregistration of the MSPO orthe GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration of the MSPO. The GO assigns himself as MSP. The GO informs the MSPO about the end of the assignment and the beginning of the assignment of the GO. The GO informs the MPO about the assignmentof the GO. The GO informs the SP about the assignment of the GO..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- MSPO deregisters at the GO: deregister_MSPO
- GO verifies the deregistration: verify_deregistration
- GO rejects the deregistration of the MSPO: reject_deregistration
- GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration of the MSPO: preliminary_confirm_deregistration
- GO assigns himself as MSP: assign_GO_as_MSP
- GO informs the MSPO about the end of the assignment and the beginning of the assignment of the GO: inform_MSPO_about_assignment_change
- GO informs the MPO about the assignment of the GO: inform_MPO_about_assignment
- GO informs the SP about the assignment of the GO: inform_SP_about_assignment

Activities: deregister_MSPO, verify_deregistration, reject_deregistration, preliminary_confirm_deregistration, assign_GO_as_MSP, inform_MSPO_about_assignment_change, inform_MPO_about_assignment, inform_SP_about_assignment

Based on the process description, we can derive the following sequence and constraints:

1. The process starts with deregister_MSPO.
   - Init(deregister_MSPO)

2. Verification happens after deregistration.
   - response(deregister_MSPO, verify_deregistration)

3. The process involves either rejection or preliminary confirmation after verification.
   - exclusive-choice(reject_deregistration, preliminary_confirm_deregistration)

4. Assignment of GO as MSP happens after preliminary confirmation or rejection is not explicitly stated but seems to follow verification or confirmation/rejection.
   - precedence(verify_deregistration, assign_GO_as_MSP)
   - precedence(preliminary_confirm_deregistration, assign_GO_as_MSP)
   - precedence(reject_deregistration, assign_GO_as_MSP)

5. Informing MSPO, MPO, and SP about the assignment change happens after GO assigns himself as MSP.
   - response(assign_GO_as_MSP, inform_MSPO_about_assignment_change)
   - response(assign_GO_as_MSP, inform_MPO_about_assignment)
   - response(assign_GO_as_MSP, inform_SP_about_assignment)

6. Since GO informs all parties after assigning himself as MSP, these activities seem to always happen together.
   - co-existence(inform_MSPO_about_assignment_change, inform_MPO_about_assignment)
   - co-existence(inform_MSPO_about_assignment_change, inform_SP_about_assignment)
   - co-existence(inform_MPO_about_assignment, inform_SP_about_assignment)

However, given the complexity and aiming for simplicity and accuracy:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(deregister_MSPO)
response(deregister_MSPO, verify_deregistration)
exclusive-choice(reject_deregistration, preliminary_confirm_deregistration)
precedence(verify_deregistration, assign_GO_as_MSP)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The fault detector reports a failure to the MPO or MPO has a suspicion of their own fault. The MPO shall examine thefailure. The MPO rejects the failure of the fault detector or the MPO confirms the failure of the fault detector. If the MPO confirms the failure of the fault detector, he informes the GO and the MSP. The MPO fixes the fault at the measuring device. The MPO shares the results of the repairs carried out with the fault detector. The MPO will inform the GO about the resolution of the interference. The MPO will inform the MSP about the resolution of the interference..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- fault_detector_reports_failure
- mpo_examines_failure
- mpo_rejects_failure
- mpo_confirms_failure
- mpo_informs_go
- mpo_informs_msp
- mpo_fixes_fault
- mpo_shares_repair_results
- mpo_informs_go_about_resolution
- mpo_informs_msp_about_resolution

## Step 1: Identify Key Activities and Their Relationships
From the process description, we can see the following key relationships:
- The MPO examines the failure reported by the fault detector.
- The MPO either rejects or confirms the failure.
- If the MPO confirms the failure, they inform the GO and MSP, then fix the fault.
- After fixing the fault, the MPO shares the results with the fault detector and informs the GO and MSP about the resolution.

## 2: Determine Declarative Constraints
Based on the description:
1. **Init**: The process seems to start with "fault_detector_reports_failure" or "mpo_has_suspicion_of_own_fault", but since "mpo_examines_failure" follows these, we can imply that "mpo_examines_failure" must occur after one of these initial activities. However, for simplicity and given the template, let's focus on the activities directly mentioned.

2. **Succession**:
   - succession(fault_detector_reports_failure, mpo_examines_failure)
   - succession(mpo_confirms_failure, mpo_informs_go)
   - succession(mpo_confirms_failure, mpo_informs_msp)
   - succession(mpo_informs_go, mpo_fixes_fault) is not directly stated but implied in order.
   - succession(mpo_fixes_fault, mpo_shares_repair_results)

3. **Response**:
   - response(mpo_confirms_failure, mpo_informs_go)
   - response(mpo_confirms_failure, mpo_informs_msp)
   - response(mpo_fixes_fault, mpo_shares_repair_results)

4. **Precedence**:
   - precedence(mpo_examines_failure, mpo_rejects_failure)
   - precedence(mpo_examines_failure, mpo_confirms_failure)

5. **Co-existence**:
   - This doesn't seem directly applicable but we see that certain activities happen together or in a specific order.

## 3: Apply Implications and Simplify
Given the implications between constraints, we should aim to use the strongest (highest level) constraints that imply others.

## 4: Formulate Final Constraints
Based on the process and aiming for simplicity and adherence to implications:

Activities: fault_detector_reports_failure, mpo_examines_failure, mpo_rejects_failure, mpo_confirms_failure, mpo_informs_go, mpo_informs_msp, mpo_fixes_fault, mpo_shares_repair_results, mpo_informs_go_about_resolution, mpo_informs_msp_about_resolution

```
Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
succession(fault_detector_reports_failure, mpo_examines_failure)
response(mpo_confirms_failure, mpo_informs_go)
response(mpo_confirms_failure, mpo_informs_msp)
succession(mpo_informs_go, mpo_fixes_fault)
succession(mpo_fixes_fault, mpo_shares_repair_results)
response(mpo_fixes_fault, mpo_informs_go_about_resolution)
response(mpo_fixes_fault, mpo_informs_msp_about_resolution)
precedence(mpo_examines_failure, mpo_rejects_failure)
precedence(mpo_examines_failure, mpo_confirms_failure)
```

This formulation captures the essential flow and relationships described in the process, focusing on succession, response, and precedence to ensure the activities occur in the correct order and relationship as described. Note that some constraints might be implied by others (e.g., through hierarchical relationships), and this selection aims for clarity and direct relevance to the described process steps.

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental health care institute.This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment. The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient. On the basis of this information, the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in. The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental, health, and social state of the patient in question. This information is recorded on a registration form. At the end of the conversation, this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute. Here, the informationon the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed. For new patients, a patient file is created. The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file. Patient files arekept at the secretarial office and may not leave the building. At the secretarial office, two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient. The registration card contains a set of basic patient data. The new patient is added on the list of new notices. Halfway the week, at Wednesday, a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place. The medical team consists of social-medical workers, physicians, and a psychiatrist. At this meeting, the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team. Each patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker, who will act as the first intaker of the patient. One of the physicianswill act as the second intaker. In assigning intakers, the teamleader takes into account their expertise, the region they are responsible for, earlier contacts they might have had with the patient, and their case load. The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office. For each new assignment, it is also determinedwhether the medical file of the patient is required. This information is added to the assignment list. The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system. It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient. An intaker keeps this registration withhim at times when visiting the patient and in his close proximity when he is at the office. For each patient for which the medical file is required, the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient, requesting for a copy of the medical file. As soon as this copy is received, the secretarial office will inform the secondintaker and add the copy to the patient file. The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible. During the first meeting, the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out. Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook. After a visit, the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient. The standard checklist is also added to the patients file. The second intaker plans the first meeting onlyafter the medical information of the physician if required has been received. Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients. The secretarial office types out these tapes, after which the information is added to the patient file. As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place, the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status. For the staff meeting on Wednesday, they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients. For each of these patients, the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan. This treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesand then relate them based on the process description.

## Step 1: Identify Key Activities
The key activities mentioned in the process description include:
- Notice by telephone
- Inquiry about patient information
- Conversation with nursing officer
- Recording information on a registration form
- Storing information in the information system
- Creating a patient file
- Producing registration cards
- Staff meeting
- Assigning patients to team members
- Determining if a medical file is required
- Storing assignments in the information system
- Passing registration cards to intakers
- Preparing and sending a letter for a medical file
- Planning a meeting with the patient
- Examining the patient
- Recording observations
- Adding information to the patient file
- Typing out dictaphones
- Formulating a treatment plan

## Step 2: Analyze Relationships Between Activities
Based on the description:
- The process starts with "Notice by telephone".
- "Inquiry about patient information" and "Conversation with nursing officer" happen before "Recording information on aregistration form".
- "Storing information in the information system" and "Creating a patient file" are related to patient intake.
- "Producing registration cards" and "Assigning patients to team members" are crucial for team assignments.
- "Planning a meeting with the patient" and "Examining the patient" are key steps for intakers.

## 3: Derive Declarative Constraints
From the description, we can derive the following constraints:

1. **Init(Notice by telephone)**: The process starts with a notice by telephone.
2. **Response(Notice by telephone, Inquiry about patient information)**: After a notice, there's an inquiry about patient information.
3. **Response(Inquiry about patient information, Conversation with nursing officer)**: The conversation happens after inquiring about patient information.
4. **Succession(Recording information on a registration form, Storing information in the information system)**: Information is stored after it's recorded.
5. **Co-existence(Assigning patients to team members, Determining if a medical file is required)**: These activities are related and happen together for each patient.
6. **Not-succession(Assigning patients to team members, Preparing and sending a letter for a medical file)**: Assigningpatients doesn't directly lead to sending a letter for a medical file.
7. **Response(Planning a meeting with the patient, Examining the patient)**: A meeting is planned before examining the patient.
8. **Succession(Examining the patient, Recording observations)**: Observations are recorded after examination.

## 4: Consider Implied Constraints and Hierarchies
Given the hierarchical relationships between constraints, we need to ensure that only the strongest (highest level) constraint is present in the final list.

## 5: Finalize Declarative Constraints
Based on the analysis and considering the implications:

**Activities: notice by telephone, inquiry about patient information, conversation with nursing officer, recording information on a registration form, storing information in the information system, creating a patient file, producing registration cards, staff meeting, assigning patients to team members, determining if a medical file is required, storing assignments in the information system, passing registration cards to intakers, preparing and sending a letter for a medical file, planning a meeting with the patient, examining the patient, recording observations, adding information to the patient file, typing out dictaphones, formulating a treatment plan**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**
1. Init(notice by telephone)
2. Response(notice by telephone, inquiry about patient information)
3. Response(inquiry about patient information, conversation with nursing officer)
4. Succession(recording information on a registration form, storing information in the information system)
5. Co-existence(assigning patients to team members, determining if a medical file is required)
6. Response(planning a meeting with the patient, examining the patient)
7. Succession(examining the patient, recording observations)

Please let me know if further clarification or details are needed.

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The Customer Service Representative sends a Mortgage offer to the customer and waits for a reply. If the customer calls or writes back declining the mortgage, the case details are updated and the work is then archived prior to cancellation. If the customer sends back the completed offer documents and attaches all prerequisite documents then the case is moved to administration for completion. If all pre-requisite documents are not provided a message is generated to the customer requesting outstanding documents. If no answer is received after 2 weeks, the case details are updated prior to archive and cancellation..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- send_mortgage_offer
- wait_for_reply
- update_case_details
- archive
- cancel
- send_completed_offer_documents
- move_to_administration
- generate_message_requesting_documents
- receive_no_reply

Based on the process description, here are the key points to consider:

1. The process starts with sending a mortgage offer.
2. If the customer declines, the case is updated, archived, and canceled.
3. If the customer sends back completed offer documents with all prerequisite documents, the case is moved to administration.
4. If not all documents are provided, a message is generated requesting outstanding documents.
5. If there's no reply after 2 weeks, the case details are updated before archiving and cancellation.

## Step 1: Identify Initial Activities and Constraints
The process starts with "send_mortgage_offer," which implies:
- Init(send_mortgage_offer)

## Step 2: Determine Existence and Response Constraints
- The customer must respond or not respond, implying that "send_mortgage_offer" must be followed by some form of customer action or inaction.
- If the customer declines, "update_case_details," "archive," and "cancel" occur.
- If the customer provides completed documents, "move_to_administration" occurs.

## 3: Analyze Precedence and Succession
- "update_case_details" precedes "archive" and "cancel" if the customer declines.
- "send_completed_offer_documents" and prerequisite documents precede "move_to_administration."

## 4: Identify Specific Constraints
- If "send_mortgage_offer" is sent, then at some point, either "update_case_details" and then "archive" and "cancel" happen, or "move_to_administration" happens. This suggests a succession or response.
- "generate_message_requesting_documents" happens if not all documents are provided, suggesting a response to lack of documents.

## 5: Formulate Declarative Constraints
Based on the description:
- Init(send_mortgage_offer)
- response(send_mortgage_offer, update_case_details)
- response(send_mortgage_offer, send_completed_offer_documents)
- precedence(send_completed_offer_documents, move_to_administration)
- existence(send_mortgage_offer)
- not-succession(send_mortgage_offer, archive)  # Because send_mortgage_offer is the start and archive happens later
- succession(send_mortgage_offer, update_case_details or archive and cancel or move_to_administration)

However, to accurately reflect the given instructions and process, let's refine:

## Step 6: Refine and Finalize Constraints
Given the complexity and ensuring we capture the essence:
- Init(send_mortgage_offer)
- response(send_mortgage_offer, update_case_details)
- response(send_mortgage_offer, send_completed_offer_documents)
- precedence(send_completed_offer_documents, move_to_administration)
- existence(send_mortgage_offer)
- succession(send_mortgage_offer, (update_case_details and archive and cancel) or move_to_administration)

But to fit the exact template and ensuring simplicity:
- Init(send_mortgage_offer)
- response(send_mortgage_offer, update_case_details)
- precedence(send_completed_offer_documents, move_to_administration)

The final answer is:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(send_mortgage_offer)
response(send_mortgage_offer, update_case_details)
precedence(send_completed_offer_documents, move_to_administration)
existence(send_mortgage_offer)
not-co-existence(archive, send_mortgage_offer)
not-response(update_case_details, send_mortgage_offer)

Activities: send_mortgage_offer, update_case_details, archive, cancel, send_completed_offer_documents, move_to_administration, generate_message_requesting_documents, receive_no_reply

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The MPOO deregisters at the GO. The GO verifies the deregistration. The GO rejects the deregistration of the MPOO orthe GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration of the MPOO. The GO prepares the readmission of the measuring point. Optionally, the GO may oblige the MPOO to continue the operations. If the GO binds the MPOO to continue the operation, the MPOO confirmes the continuation to the MPOO. The GO performs the equipment acquisition and / or equipment changes. TheGO assigns the GO as MPO. The GO informs the MPOO about the end of the assignment of the MPOO and the beginning of the assignment of the GO. The GO informs the MSPO about the assignment of the GO. The GO informs the SP about the assignmentof the GO..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- MPOO deregisters at the GO
- GO verifies the deregistration
- GO rejects the deregistration of the MPOO
- GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration of the MPOO
- GO prepares the readmission of the measuring point
- GO obliges the MPOO to continue the operations
- MPOO confirms the continuation to the MPOO
- GO performs the equipment acquisition and/or equipment changes
- GO assigns the GO as MPO
- GO informs the MPOO about the end of the assignment of the MPOO and the beginning of the assignment of the GO
- GO informs the MSPO about the assignment of the GO
- GO informs the SP about the assignment of the GO

Activities: MPOO deregisters at the GO, GO verifies the deregistration, GO rejects the deregistration, GO preliminarilyconfirms the deregistration, GO prepares the readmission, GO obliges MPOO to continue operations, MPOO confirms continuation, GO performs equipment acquisition/changes, GO assigns GO as MPO, GO informs MPOO, GO informs MSPO, GO informs SP

## Step 1: Identify the main sequence of activities
The process starts with "MPOO deregisters at the GO" followed by "GO verifies the deregistration." This indicates a sequence.

## Step 2: Determine the existence of specific activities
- "MPOO deregisters at the GO" must occur at least once.
- "GO verifies the deregistration" must occur after "MPOO deregisters at the GO".

## Step 3: Analyze conditional sequences
- If "GO obliges the MPOO to continue the operations", then "MPOO confirms the continuation to the MPOO" must occur.

## Step 4: Identify parallel or alternative paths
- The GO either "rejects the deregistration of the MPOO" or "preliminarily confirms the deregistration of the MPOO".

## Step 5: Determine succession and precedence constraints
- "GO verifies the deregistration" must occur before "GO rejects the deregistration of the MPOO" or "GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration of the MPOO".
- "GO obliges the MPOO to continue the operations" implies "MPOO confirms the continuation to the MPOO".

## 6: Formulate declarative constraints
Based on the analysis:
- existence(MPOO deregisters at the GO)
- response(MPOO deregisters at the GO, GO verifies the deregistration)
- choice(GO rejects the deregistration, GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration)
- precedence(GO verifies the deregistration, GO rejects the deregistration)
- precedence(GO verifies the deregistration, GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration)
- response(GO obliges MPOO to continue operations, MPOO confirms continuation)
- succession(GO obliges MPOO to continue operations, MPOO confirms continuation)

## 7: Refine and simplify constraints
Given the implications between constraints, we focus on the strongest (highest level) constraints.

The final answer is:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
existence(MPOO deregisters at the GO)
response(MPOO deregisters at the GO, GO verifies the deregistration)
choice(GO rejects the deregistration, GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration)
precedence(GO verifies the deregistration, GO rejects the deregistration)
precedence(GO verifies the deregistration, GO preliminarily confirms the deregistration)
response(GO obliges MPOO to continue operations, MPOO confirms continuation)
succession(GO obliges MPOO to continue operations, MPOO confirms continuation)

Activities: MPOO deregisters at the GO, GO verifies the deregistration, GO rejects the deregistration, GO preliminarilyconfirms the deregistration, GO prepares the readmission, GO obliges MPOO to continue operations, MPOO confirms continuation, GO performs equipment acquisition/changes, GO assigns GO as MPO, GO informs MPOO, GO informs MSPO, GO informs SP

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request. Once the requirement is registered, the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation. The supervisor must approve or reject the request. If the request is rejected, the application is returned to the applicant / employee who can review the rejection reasons. If the request is approved a notification is generated to the Human Resources Representative, who must complete the respective management procedures..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- submit_vacation_request
- approve_request
- reject_request
- notify_employee
- manage_vacation
- review_rejection

Based on the process description, here are the steps and the corresponding constraints:

1. The process starts with an employee submitting a vacation request.
   - **Init(submit_vacation_request)**

2. The immediate supervisor must approve or reject the request.
   - **exclusive-choice(approve_request, reject_request)**

3. If the request is rejected, the application is returned to the applicant/employee.
   - **response(reject_request, notify_employee)**

4. If the request is approved, a notification is generated to the Human Resources Representative.
   - **response(approve_request, manage_vacation)**

5. The employee can review the rejection reasons if the request is rejected.
   - **not-response(reject_request, manage_vacation)**
   - **not-precedence(notify_employee, manage_vacation)**

6. Ensure that after approval, the management procedures are completed without any other activity in between.
   - **chain-response(approve_request, manage_vacation)**

7. Ensure that both approval and rejection are considered and lead to different outcomes without one implying the otherdirectly.
   - **not-succession(approve_request, reject_request)**
   - **not-co-existence(approve_request, reject_request)**

Given these points, let's refine and simplify the constraints:

**Temporary Declarative Constraints:**

- Init(submit_vacation_request)
- exclusive-choice(approve_request, reject_request)
- response(reject_request, notify_employee)
- response(approve_request, manage_vacation)
- chain-response(approve_request, manage_vacation)
- not-succession(approve_request, reject_request)
- not-co-existence(approve_request, reject_request)

**Activities:** submit_vacation_request, approve_request, reject_request, notify_employee, manage_vacation

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

- Init(submit_vacation_request)
- exclusive-choice(approve_request, reject_request)
- response(reject_request, notify_employee)
- response(approve_request, manage_vacation)
- chain-response(approve_request, manage_vacation)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   As a basic principle, ACME AG receives invoices on paper or fax. These are received by the Secretariat in the central inbox and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee. In `` ACME Financial Accounting ``, a software specially developed for the ACME AG, she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance (invoice).She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form (`` docket ``). The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list. He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice. Should everything be in order, he notes his code one on the docket (`` accurate position - AP ``) and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail. From it, the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager, based on the docket, or if all items are marked correct, sent back to accounting. Therefore, the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate. However, if inconsistencies exist, e.g. because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality, the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket, and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly. Based on the statements of the cost center managers, she will proceede with the clarification with the vendor, but, if necessary, she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e-mail again. When all inconsistencies are resolved, the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again, and the process continues. After all invoice items are AP, the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager. He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment. If the bill amount exceeds EUR20, the Board wants to check it again (4 - eyes-principle). The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file. Should there be a complaint during the commercial audit, it will be resolved by the accounting employee with the supplier. After the commercial audit is successfully completed, the accounting employee gives payment instructions and closes the instance in `` ACME financial accounting ``..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesand then map them to the provided constraint templates.

**Activities:**
- receiving_invoices, forwarding_invoices, identifying_suppliers, creating_invoices, checking_invoices, noting_cost_centers, sending_dockets, reviewing_content, marking_accuracy, returning_invoices, sending_to_accounting, clarifying_inconsistencies, consulting_cost_center_managers, forwarding_to_commercial_manager, commercial_audit, issuing_approval, checking_by_board, resolving_complaints, giving_payment_instructions

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The first step is to determine contact details of potential customers. This can be achieved in several ways. Sometimes, we buy details for cold calls, sometimes, our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes, you just happen to know somebody, who is interested in the product. Then we start calling the customer. That is done by the call center staff. They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project. Of course, asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important. If this is not the case, we leave him alone, except if the potential project budget is huge. Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer. Ifthe customer is interested in the end, the next step is a detailed online presentation. It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation. Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us. If we are not contacted within 2 weeks, a sales representative is calling the customer. The last phase is the creation of a quotation..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- determine contact details
- buy details for cold calls
- participate in exhibitions
- know somebody interested
- call customer
- determine contact person and budget
- ask customer interested
- head of development tries to acquire
- detailed online presentation
- wait for customer to come back
- sales representative calls customer
- creation of quotation

The process description can be broken down into several steps, and we can derive constraints based on the relationshipsbetween these steps.

## Step 1: Identify Key Relationships
- The process starts with determining contact details, which can be achieved through several means (buy details, participate in exhibitions, know somebody interested).
- Calling the customer and determining their interest are crucial steps.
- If the customer is not interested but has a huge budget, the head of development tries to acquire them.
- A detailed online presentation is given if the customer is interested.
- Waiting for the customer to come back and potentially a follow-up call if not contacted within 2 weeks.
- The process ends with the creation of a quotation.

## Step 2: Derive Constraints
1. **Init(determine contact details)**: The process must start with determining contact details.
2. **existence(determine contact details)**: Determining contact details must occur at least once.
3. **response(determine contact details, call customer)**: After determining contact details, the customer must be called.
4. **response(call customer, ask customer interested)**: Calling the customer must be followed by asking if they are interested.
5. **not-response(ask customer interested, detailed online presentation) if not interested**: If the customer is not interested, a detailed online presentation does not occur without the head of development trying to acquire the customer first, especially if the budget is huge.
6. **response(ask customer interested, detailed online presentation) if interested**: If the customer is interested, a detailed online presentation must occur.
7. **precedence(detailed online presentation, wait for customer to come back)**: A detailed online presentation must occur before waiting for the customer to come back.
8. **not-succession(wait for customer to come back, creation of quotation)**: The creation of a quotation cannot occur immediately after waiting for the customer to come back; there might be a follow-up call.
9. **response(sales representative calls customer, creation of quotation)**: If a sales representative calls the customer, it must be followed by the creation of a quotation.

## Step 3: Refine and Simplify Constraints
Given the implications between constraints, we need to ensure that only the strongest (highest level) constraints are present.

## Step 4: List Activities and Constraints
**Activities: determine contact details, buy details for cold calls, participate in exhibitions, know somebody interested, call customer, determine contact person and budget, ask customer interested, head of development tries to acquire, detailed online presentation, wait for customer to come back, sales representative calls customer, creation of quotation**

**Temporary Declarative Constraints:**
- Init(determine contact details)
- existence(determine contact details)
- response(determine contact details, call customer)
- response(call customer, ask customer interested)
- precedence(detailed online presentation, wait for customer to come back)
- response(sales representative calls customer, creation of quotation)

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**
- Init(determine contact details)
- existence(determine contact details)
- response(determine contact details, call customer)
- response(call customer, ask customer interested)
- precedence(detailed online presentation, wait for customer to come back)
- response(sales representative calls customer, creation of quotation)
- succession(ask customer interested, detailed online presentation)

The final answer is:
Activities: determine contact details, buy details for cold calls, participate in exhibitions, know somebody interested, call customer, determine contact person and budget, ask customer interested, head of development tries to acquire, detailed online presentation, wait for customer to come back, sales representative calls customer, creation of quotation
Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
Init(determine contact details)
existence(determine contact details)
response(determine contact details, call customer)
response(call customer, ask customer interested)
precedence(detailed online presentation, wait for customer to come back)
response(sales representative calls customer, creation of quotation)
succession(ask customer interested, detailed online presentation)

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   After the Expense Report is received, a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one. The report is then reviewed for automatic approval. Amounts under $200 are automatically approved, whereas amounts equal to or over $200 require approval of the supervisor. In case of rejection, the employee must receive a rejection notice by email. Otherwise, the reimbursement goes to the employees direct deposit bank account. If the request is not completed in 7 days, then the employee must receive an approval in progress email. If the request is not finished within 30 days, then the process is stopped and the employee receives an email cancellation notice and must re-submit the expense report..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- Receiving Expense Report
- Creating new account
- Reviewing report
- Automatic approval
- Approval by supervisor
- Rejection
- Sending rejection notice
- Reimbursement to direct deposit
- Sending approval in progress email
- Sending cancellation notice

Now, let's analyze the process description to extract the constraints:

1. **After the Expense Report is received, a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one.**
   - This implies that "Creating new account" must occur after "Receiving Expense Report" if certain conditions are met, suggesting a **precedence** relationship but with a condition. However, directly translating this into a given template, we focus on the existence and succession:

2. **The report is then reviewed for automatic approval.**
   - **Reviewing report** must occur.

3. **Amounts under $200 are automatically approved, whereas amounts equal to or over $200 require approval of the supervisor.**
   - This suggests a **choice** between **Automatic approval** and **Approval by supervisor**.

4. **In case of rejection, the employee must receive a rejection notice by email.**
   - If **Rejection** occurs, then **Sending rejection notice** must occur.

5. **Otherwise, the reimbursement goes to the employees direct deposit bank account.**
   - Suggests that if not **Rejection**, then **Reimbursement to direct deposit**.

6. **If the request is not completed in 7 days, then the employee must receive an approval in progress email.**
   - Implies a **response** relationship: If the request is not completed, **Sending approval in progress email** must occur.

7. **If the request is not finished within 30 days, then the process is stopped and the employee receives an email cancellation notice and must re-submit the expense report.**
   - Implies **not-response** and **not-succession** constraints for the process stopping.

Given these points, let's draft some initial constraints:

- **existence(Reviewing report)**
- **choice(Automatic approval, Approval by supervisor)**
- **response(Rejection, Sending rejection notice)**
- **not-response(Rejection, Reimbursement to direct deposit)**
- **response(not completed within 7 days, Sending approval in progress email)**
- **not-succession(not finished within 30 days, Reimbursement to direct deposit)**
- **not-response(not finished within 30 days, Cancellation notice)**
- **precedence(Receiving Expense Report, Creating new account)**

However, let's refine and accurately map these to provided templates and ensure we capture the essence:

**Activities: Receiving Expense Report, Creating new account, Reviewing report, Automatic approval, Approval by supervisor, Rejection, Sending rejection notice, Reimbursement to direct deposit, Sending approval in progress email, Sending cancellation notice**

**Temporary Declarative Constraints:**
- existence(Reviewing report)
- choice(Automatic approval, Approval by supervisor)
- response(Rejection, Sending rejection notice)
- not-response(Rejection, Reimbursement to direct deposit)
- response(Absence of completion within 7 days, Sending approval in progress email)
- not-response(Absence of completion within 30 days, Reimbursement to direct deposit)
- precedence(Receiving Expense Report, Creating new account)

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**
- existence(Reviewing report)
- choice(Automatic approval, Approval by supervisor)
- response(Rejection, Sending rejection notice)
- not-response(Rejection, Reimbursement to direct deposit)
- response(not completed within 7 days, Sending approval in progress email)
- not-response(not finished within 30 days, Reimbursement to direct deposit)
- precedence(Receiving Expense Report, Creating new account)
- not-exclusive-choice(Sending approval in progress email, Sending cancellation notice)

Given the complexity and ensuring clarity, let's finalize:

**Activities: Receiving Expense Report, Creating new account, Reviewing report, Automatic approval, Approval by supervisor, Rejection, Sending rejection notice, Reimbursement to direct deposit, Sending approval in progress email, Sending cancellation notice**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The MPON requests a device takeover bid of the MPOO. The MPOO sends a tender for the equipment takeover to the MPON.The MPON places an order at the MPOO. The MPOO confirms the order of the MPON and sends the master data..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

1. MPON requests a device takeover bid of the MPOO. - Activity: request_bid
2. MPOO sends a tender for the equipment takeover to the MPON. - Activity: send_tender
3. MPON places an order at the MPOO. - Activity: place_order
4. MPOO confirms the order of the MPON and sends the master data. - Activity: confirm_order

Activities: request_bid, send_tender, place_order, confirm_order

Now, let's analyze the sequence and relationships:

1. The process starts with MPON requesting a bid, then MPOO sends a tender, followed by MPON placing an order, and finally MPOO confirming the order.

From the description, we can derive the following constraints:

- The process starts with request_bid, so: Init(request_bid)
- send_tender occurs after request_bid: response(request_bid, send_tender)
- place_order occurs after send_tender: response(send_tender, place_order)
- confirm_order occurs after place_order: response(place_order, confirm_order)

Also, all activities must happen in a specific order without any mentioned parallel executions or skips, suggesting a succession:

- succession(request_bid, send_tender)
- succession(send_tender, place_order)
- succession(place_order, confirm_order)

Given the implications:
- Succession implies Co-Existence (but we focus on the stronger constraints directly derivable)
- Succession implies Response (which is already considered)

Temporary Declarative Constraints:
- Init(request_bid)
- response(request_bid, send_tender)
- response(send_tender, place_order)
- response(place_order, confirm_order)
- succession(request_bid, send_tender)
- succession(send_tender, place_order)
- succession(place_order, confirm_order)

However, upon closer inspection and applying the implications for constraint strengthening and redundancy removal:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
- Init(request_bid)
- succession(request_bid, send_tender)
- succession(send_tender, place_order)
- succession(place_order, confirm_order)

Activities: request_bid, send_tender, place_order, confirm_order

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   Each morning, the files which have yet to be processed need to be checked, to make sure they are in order for the court hearing that day. If some files are missing, a search is initiated, otherwise the files can be physically tracked tothe intended location. Once all the files are ready, these are handed to the Associate, and meantime the Judgeis Lawlist is distributed to the relevant people. Afterwards, the directions hearings are conducted..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- Checking files
- Searching for missing files
- Physically tracking files
- Handing files to the Associate
- Distributing the Judge's Lawlist
- Conducting directions hearings

From the description, we can infer the following:

1. The process starts with checking files, so we have an **Init** constraint for "checking files".

2. If files are missing, a search is initiated. This implies that if "searching for missing files" occurs, then "checking files" must have occurred before, suggesting a **precedence** constraint: precedence(checking files, searching for missing files).

3. Files can be physically tracked if they are in order, implying that "physically tracking files" and "searching for missing files" are alternatives to ensure files are ready, suggesting an **exclusive-choice** constraint: exclusive-choice(searching for missing files, physically tracking files).

4. Once all files are ready, they are handed to the Associate. This doesn't directly imply a specific constraint but indicates that "handing files to the Associate" happens after files are ready, which could be after either "searching for missing files" or "physically tracking files". This implies a **response** constraint for both: response(searching for missing files, handing files to the Associate) and response(physically tracking files, handing files to the Associate).

5. Meanwhile, the Judge's Lawlist is distributed. This happens alongside handing files to the Associate but doesn't specify it must happen immediately after or before, just that it happens. This could imply a **co-existence** or **not-succession** constraint but given the text, it seems more like a parallel task: not-succession(handing files to the Associate, distributing the Judge's Lawlist).

6. Directions hearings are conducted afterwards, implying that **succession** constraints exist for activities before it: succession(handing files to the Associate, conducting directions hearings) and possibly succession(distributing the Judge's Lawlist, conducting directions hearings).

Given these observations and the aim for simplicity and higher-level constraints:

**Activities: checking files, searching for missing files, physically tracking files, handing files to the Associate, distributing the Judge's Lawlist, conducting directions hearings**

**Temporary Declarative Constraints:**
- Init(checking files)
- precedence(checking files, searching for missing files)
- exclusive-choice(searching for missing files, physically tracking files)
- response(searching for missing files, handing files to the Associate)
- response(physically tracking files, handing files to the Associate)
- not-succession(handing files to the Associate, distributing the Judge's Lawlist)
- succession(handing files to the Associate, conducting directions hearings)
- succession(distributing the Judge's Lawlist, conducting directions hearings)

These can be further reduced considering the implications:

- **Init(checking files)**
- **precedence(checking files, searching for missing files)**
- **exclusive-choice(searching for missing files, physically tracking files)**
- **response(searching for missing files, handing files to the Associate)**
- **not-succession(handing files to the Associate, distributing the Judge's Lawlist)**
- **succession(handing files to the Associate, conducting directions hearings)**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**
- Init(checking files)
- precedence(checking files, searching for missing files)
- exclusive-choice(searching for missing files, physically tracking files)
- response(searching for missing files, handing files to the Associate)
- not-succession(handing files to the Associate, distributing the Judge's Lawlist)
- succession(handing files to the Associate, conducting directions hearings)

**Activities: checking files, searching for missing files, physically tracking files, handing files to the Associate, distributing the Judge's Lawlist, conducting directions hearings**

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   Mail from the party is collected on a daily basis by the Mail Processing Unit. Within this unit, the Mail Clerk sorts the unopened mail into the various business areas. The mail is then distributed. When the mail is received by the Registry, it is opened and sorted into groups for distribution, and thus registered in a manual incoming Mail Register. Afterwards, the Assistant Registry Manager within the Registry performs a quality check. If the mail is not compliant, a list of requisition explaining the reason for rejection is compiled and sent back to the party. Otherwise, the matter details (types of action) are captured and provided to the Cashier, who takes the applicable fees attached to the mail. At this point, the Assistant Registry Manager puts the receipt and copied documents into an envelope and posts it to the party. Meantime, the Cashier captures the Party Details and prints the Physical Court File..

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The loan approval process starts by receiving a customer request for a loan amount. The risk assessment Web service is invoked to assess the request. If the loan is small and the customer is low risk, the loan is approved. If the customer is high risk, the loan is denied. If the customer needs further review or the loan amount is for $10,000 or more, therequest is sent to the approver Web service. The customer receives feedback from the assessor or approver..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesmentioned:

- Receiving a customer request for a loan amount
- Invoking the risk assessment Web service
- Approving the loan
- Denying the loan
- Sending the request to the approver Web service
- Receiving feedback from the assessor or approver

Let's label these activities for clarity:

- receive_customer_request
- invoke_risk_assessment
- approve_loan
- deny_loan
- send_to_approver
- receive_feedback

From the description, we can derive the following:

1. **The process starts with receiving a customer request**, which implies:
   - Init(receive_customer_request)

2. **The risk assessment Web service is invoked after receiving the customer request**, suggesting:
   - succession(receive_customer_request, invoke_risk_assessment)

3. **If the loan is approved or denied, it happens after the risk assessment**, implying:
   - response(invoke_risk_assessment, approve_loan)
   - response(invoke_risk_assessment, deny_loan)

4. **The loan is approved or denied exclusively**, suggesting:
   - exclusive-choice(approve_loan, deny_loan)

5. **If the request is sent to the approver, it happens after the risk assessment**, implying:
   - response(invoke_risk_assessment, send_to_approver)

6. **The customer receives feedback after the assessment or approval/denial process**, suggesting:
   - succession(approve_loan, receive_feedback)
   - succession(deny_loan, receive_feedback)
   - succession(send_to_approver, receive_feedback)

Given these points, let's consider the implications and try to simplify:

- **Init(receive_customer_request)**
- **succession(receive_customer_request, invoke_risk_assessment)**
- **response(invoke_risk_assessment, approve_loan)**
- **response(invoke_risk_assessment, deny_loan)**
- **exclusive-choice(approve_loan, deny_loan)**
- **response(invoke_risk_assessment, send_to_approver)**
- **succession(approve_loan, receive_feedback)**
- **succession(deny_loan, receive_feedback)**
- **succession(send_to_approver, receive_feedback)**

However, upon reviewing the provided constraints and their implications, we should ensure that we're capturing the essence without redundancy:

**Activities: receive_customer_request, invoke_risk_assessment, approve_loan, deny_loan, send_to_approver, receive_feedback**

**Temporary Declarative Constraints:**

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   After a claim is registered, it is examined by a claims officer. The claims officer then writes a settlement recommendation. This recommendation is then checked by a senior claims officer who may mark the claim as OK or Not OK. If the claim is marked as Not OK, it is sent back to the claims officer and the recommendation is repeated. If the claim is OK, the claim handling process proceeds..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- register_claim
- examine_claim
- write_settlement_recommendation
- check_recommendation
- mark_claim_OK
- mark_claim_Not_OK
- send_back_to_claims_officer
- repeat_recommendation
- proceed_claim_handling

From the process description, we can derive the following:

1. The process starts with registering a claim, which implies:
   - Init(register_claim)

2. After a claim is registered, it is examined by a claims officer, implying:
   - succession(register_claim, examine_claim)
   - response(register_claim, examine_claim)  // Implies Responded-Existence

3. The claims officer then writes a settlement recommendation, implying:
   - succession(examine_claim, write_settlement_recommendation)
   - response(examine_claim, write_settlement_recommendation)

4. This recommendation is then checked by a senior claims officer, implying:
   - succession(write_settlement_recommendation, check_recommendation)
   - response(write_settlement_recommendation, check_recommendation)

5. The senior claims officer may mark the claim as OK or Not OK. If marked as Not OK, it implies:
   - not-exclusive-choice(mark_claim_OK, mark_claim_Not_OK)
   - response(check_recommendation, mark_claim_Not_OK)

6. If the claim is marked as Not OK, it is sent back to the claims officer and the recommendation is repeated, implying:
   - response(mark_claim_Not_OK, send_back_to_claims_officer)
   - response(mark_claim_Not_OK, repeat_recommendation)
   - not-response(mark_claim_OK, send_back_to_claims_officer)
   - not-response(mark_claim_OK, repeat_recommendation)

7. If the claim is OK, the claim handling process proceeds, implying:
   - response(mark_claim_OK, proceed_claim_handling)

8. Also, after a claim is registered and examined, and a recommendation is written and checked, the process can loop back if Not OK, or proceed if OK, implying various constraints but primarily focused on the sequence and choices.

However, upon analyzing the implications and trying to be succinct:

## Activities: register_claim, examine_claim, write_settlement_recommendation, check_recommendation, mark_claim_OK, mark_claim_Not_OK, send_back_to_claims_officer, repeat_recommendation, proceed_claim_handling

## Temporary Declarative Constraints:

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The party sends a warrant possession request asking a warrant to be released. The Client Service Back Office as partof the Small Claims Registry Operations receives the request and retrieves the SCT file. Then, the SCT Warrant Possession is forwarded to Queensland Police. The SCT physical file is stored by the Back Office awaiting a report to be sent bythe Police. When the report is received, the respective SCT file is retrieved. Then, Back Office attaches the new SCT document, and stores the expanded SCT physical file. After that, some other MC internal staff receives the physical SCT file (out of scope)..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities mentioned:

- sends a warrant possession request
- retrieves the SCT file
- forwards the SCT Warrant Possession to Queensland Police
- stores the SCT physical file
- receives a report
- retrieves the respective SCT file
- attaches the new SCT document
- stores the expanded SCT physical file

Based on the process description, here are the activities with their full names for clarity:

- warrant_possession_request
- retrieve_SCT_file
- forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession
- store_SCT_physical_file
- receive_report
- retrieve_SCT_file_again
- attach_SCT_document
- store_expanded_SCT_physical_file

## Step 1: Identify the sequence of activities
The process starts with sending a warrant possession request, followed by retrieving the SCT file, then forwarding the SCT Warrant Possession, and storing the SCT physical file. After receiving a report, the process involves retrieving theSCT file again, attaching a new SCT document, and finally storing the expanded SCT physical file.

## Step 2: Determine the constraints
From the description, we can derive the following sequences and relationships:
- The process starts with "sends a warrant possession request."
- "retrieve_SCT_file" happens after "sends a warrant possession request."
- "forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession" happens after "retrieve_SCT_file."
- "store_SCT_physical_file" happens after "forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession."
- "receive_report" happens after "store_SCT_physical_file."
- "retrieve_SCT_file_again" happens after "receive_report."
- "attach_SCT_document" happens after "retrieve_SCT_file_again."
- "store_expanded_SCT_physical_file" happens after "attach_SCT_document."

## 3: Translate into declarative constraints
Based on the sequence:
- precedence(retrieve_SCT_file, forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession)
- precedence(forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession, store_SCT_physical_file)
- precedence(store_SCT_physical_file, receive_report)
- precedence(receive_report, retrieve_SCT_file_again)
- precedence(retrieve_SCT_file_again, attach_SCT_document)
- precedence(attach_SCT_document, store_expanded_SCT_physical_file)

## 4: Consider existence and other constraints
- All activities must occur at least once: existence(warrant_possession_request), existence(retrieve_SCT_file), existence(forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession), existence(store_SCT_physical_file), existence(receive_report), existence(retrieve_SCT_file_again), existence(attach_SCT_document), existence(store_expanded_SCT_physical_file)

## 5: Combine and simplify constraints
Given the implications between constraints, we focus on the strongest constraints that imply others.

The final answer is:

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
precedence(retrieve_SCT_file, forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession)
precedence(forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession, store_SCT_physical_file)
precedence(store_SCT_physical_file, receive_report)
precedence(receive_report, retrieve_SCT_file_again)
precedence(retrieve_SCT_file_again, attach_SCT_document)
precedence(attach_SCT_document, store_expanded_SCT_physical_file)
existence(warrant_possession_request)
existence(retrieve_SCT_file)
existence(forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession)
existence(store_SCT_physical_file)
existence(receive_report)
existence(retrieve_SCT_file_again)
existence(attach_SCT_document)
existence(store_expanded_SCT_physical_file)
Init(warrant_possession_request)
Activities: warrant_possession_request, retrieve_SCT_file, forward_SCT_Warrant_Possession, store_SCT_physical_file, receive_report, retrieve_SCT_file_again, attach_SCT_document, store_expanded_SCT_physical_file

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The Police Report related to the car accident is searched within the Police Report database and put in a file together with the Claim Documentation. This file serves as input to a claims handler who calculates an initial claim estimate.Then, the claims handler creates an Action Plan based on an Action Plan Checklist available in the Document Management system. Based on the Action Plan, a claims manager tries to negotiate a settlement on the claim estimate. The claimant is informed of the outcome, which ends the process..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's analyze the activities and their relationships:

1. **Activities mentioned**:
   - Searching Police Report
   - Putting file together with Claim Documentation
   - Calculating initial claim estimate
   - Creating Action Plan
   - Negotiating settlement
   - Informing claimant of outcome

2. **Process Flow**:
   - The process starts with searching for a Police Report and putting a file together with Claim Documentation.
   - This is followed by calculating an initial claim estimate.
   - Then, an Action Plan is created.
   - Next, there's an attempt to negotiate a settlement.
   - The process ends with informing the claimant of the outcome.

3. **Constraint Extraction**:
   - **Succession**:
     - Searching Police Report and putting file together with Claim Documentation must be followed by calculating initial claim estimate.
     - Calculating initial claim estimate must be followed by creating Action Plan.
     - Creating Action Plan must be followed by negotiating settlement.
     - Negotiating settlement must be followed by informing claimant of outcome.

4. **Formal Declarative Constraints**:
   - **response(Searching Police Report and putting file together with Claim Documentation, Calculating initial claim estimate)**
   - **response(Calculating initial claim estimate, Creating Action Plan)**
   - **response(Creating Action Plan, Negotiating settlement)**
   - **response(Negotiating settlement, Informing claimant of outcome)**

5. **Existence Constraints**:
   - All activities must occur at least once.
   - **existence(Searching Police Report)**
   - **existence(Putting file together with Claim Documentation)**
   - **existence(Calculating initial claim estimate)**

   - **precedence(Calculating initial claim estimate, Creating Action Plan)**
   - **precedence(Creating Action Plan, Negotiating settlement)**
   - **precedence(Negotiating settlement, Informing claimant of outcome)**

7. **Coexistence and Other Constraints**:
   - Given the sequential nature, there's no clear indication of activities happening together, so no **co-existence** constraints are directly implied.

**Activities: Searching Police Report, Putting file together with Claim Documentation, Calculating initial claim estimate, Creating Action Plan, Negotiating settlement, Informing claimant of outcome**

**Temporary Declarative Constraints:**

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   The GO requests the measurements to the MSP. The MSP checks the received request. The MSP denies the request of the GO or the MSP performs the measurement. The MSP informs the GO about the failure of the reading or the MSP transmits themeasured values to the GO. The GO processes the measured values. The GO sends the changed values to the MSP. The GO transmit the readings to the SP..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the activities involved:

- GO requests the measurements to the MSP: Request_Measurements
- MSP checks the received request: Check_Request
- MSP denies the request of the GO: Deny_Request
- MSP performs the measurement: Perform_Measurement
- MSP informs the GO about the failure of the reading: Inform_Failure
- MSP transmits the measured values to the GO: Transmit_Measured_Values
- GO processes the measured values: Process_Measured_Values
- GO sends the changed values to the MSP: Send_Changed_Values
- GO transmits the readings to the SP: Transmit_Readings

Activities: Request_Measurements, Check_Request, Deny_Request, Perform_Measurement, Inform_Failure, Transmit_Measured_Values, Process_Measured_Values, Send_Changed_Values, Transmit_Readings

Based on the process description, we can derive the following steps and constraints:

1. **Request_Measurements** by GO is the starting point.
   - Init(Request_Measurements)

2. **Check_Request** must happen after **Request_Measurements**.
   - Precedence(Request_Measurements, Check_Request)

3. After **Check_Request**, either **Deny_Request** or **Perform_Measurement** happens.
   - Exclusive-Choice(Deny_Request, Perform_Measurement)

4. If **Deny_Request**, then **Inform_Failure** must happen next.
   - Response(Deny_Request, Inform_Failure)

5. If **Perform_Measurement**, then **Transmit_Measured_Values** must happen next.
   - Response(Perform_Measurement, Transmit_Measured_Values)

6. **Process_Measured_Values** happens after **Transmit_Measured_Values**.
   - Precedence(Transmit_Measured_Values, Process_Measured_Values)

7. **Send_Changed_Values** happens after **Process_Measured_Values**.
   - Precedence(Process_Measured_Values, Send_Changed_Values)

8. **Transmit_Readings** happens after **Send_Changed_Values**.
   - Precedence(Send_Changed_Values, Transmit_Readings)

9. **Inform_Failure** does not lead to **Process_Measured_Values** directly; it seems to end the process or lead to another path not described, implying:
   - Not-Succession(Inform_Failure, Process_Measured_Values)

However, upon closer inspection and to maintain simplicity and adherence to provided templates and implications:

Temporary Declarative Constraints:
- Init(Request_Measurements)
- Precedence(Request_Measurements, Check_Request)
- Exclusive-Choice(Deny_Request, Perform_Measurement)
- Response(Deny_Request, Inform_Failure)
- Response(Perform_Measurement, Transmit_Measured_Values)
- Precedence(Transmit_Measured_Values, Process_Measured_Values)
- Precedence(Process_Measured_Values, Send_Changed_Values)
- Precedence(Send_Changed_Values, Transmit_Readings)
- Not-Succession(Inform_Failure, Process_Measured_Values)

After applying implications:
- The stronger constraints that subsume weaker ones should be kept.

Final Formal Declarative Constraints:
- Init(Request_Measurements)
- Precedence(Request_Measurements, Check_Request)
- Exclusive-Choice(Deny_Request, Perform_Measurement)
- Response(Deny_Request, Inform_Failure)
- Response(Perform_Measurement, Transmit_Measured_Values)
- Precedence(Transmit_Measured_Values, Process_Measured_Values)
- Precedence(Process_Measured_Values, Send_Changed_Values)
- Precedence(Send_Changed_Values, Transmit_Readings)
- Not-Succession(Inform_Failure, Process_Measured_Values)

Activities: Request_Measurements, Check_Request, Deny_Request, Perform_Measurement, Inform_Failure, Transmit_Measured_Values, Process_Measured_Values, Send_Changed_Values, Transmit_Readings

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   An employee purchases a product or service he requires. For instance, a sales person on a trip rents a car. The employee submits an expense report with a list of items, along with the receipts for each item. A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report. Since the company has expense rules, there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection. These rules could be automated, to reduce the workload on the supervisor. If the supervisor rejects the report, the employee, who submitted it, is given a chance to edit it, for example to correct errors or better describe an expense. If the supervisor approves the report, it goes to the treasurer. The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list. If all is in order,the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing (including, e.g., payment or refund, and accounting). If receipts aremissing or do not match the report, he sends it back to the employee. If a report returns to the employee for corrections, it must again go to a supervisor, even if the supervisor previously approved the report. If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing, the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system. The process waits for the payment confirmation. After the payment is confirmed, the process ends..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesand their relationships:

1. **purchase_product_or_service** - The employee purchases a product or service.
2. **submit_expense_report** - The employee submits an expense report.
3. **review_expense_report** - A supervisor reviews the expense report.
4. **approve_report** - The supervisor approves the report.
5. **reject_report** - The supervisor rejects the report.
6. **edit_expense_report** - The employee edits the expense report.
7. **check_receipts** - The treasurer checks the receipts.
8. **accept_expenses** - The treasurer accepts the expenses for processing.
9. **send_back_for_corrections** - The treasurer sends the report back to the employee for corrections.
10. **link_to_payment_system** - The report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system.
11. **wait_for_payment_confirmation** - The process waits for the payment confirmation.
12. **end_process** - The process ends.

Based on the process description, here are the declarative constraints:

- **Init(submit_expense_report)**: The process starts with the employee submitting an expense report.
- **Response(review_expense_report, approve_report or reject_report)**: After reviewing the expense report, the supervisor must either approve or reject it.
- **Response(approve_report, check_receipts)**: If the report is approved, it goes to the treasurer for checking receipts.
- **Response(reject_report, edit_expense_report)**: If the report is rejected, the employee must edit it.
- **Precedence(approve_report, check_receipts)**: The treasurer checks receipts only after the report has been approved.
- **Precedence(submit_expense_report, review_expense_report)**: The supervisor reviews the report after it has been submitted.
- **Not-Succession(edit_expense_report, review_expense_report)**: Editing the expense report does not directly lead to another review without submission.
- **Succession(accept_expenses, link_to_payment_system)**: Accepting expenses leads to linking to the payment system.
- **Response(send_back_for_corrections, review_expense_report)**: If the report is sent back for corrections, it must go back to the supervisor for review.
- **Existence(end_process)**: The process must end.

**Activities: submit_expense_report, review_expense_report, approve_report, reject_report, edit_expense_report, check_receipts, accept_expenses, send_back_for_corrections, link_to_payment_system, wait_for_payment_confirmation, end_process,purchase_product_or_service**

   It is currently analysing the dataset phrase:
   A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated foreach item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance..


ðŸ’» AI: To translate the given process description into declarative constraints, let's first identify the key activitiesand their relationships:

1. **Activities identified**:
   - Receive order
   - Accept order
   - Reject order
   - Inform storehouse
   - Inform engineering
   - Process part list
   - Reserve part
   - Back-order part
   - Prepare assembly
   - Assemble bicycle
   - Ship bicycle

2. **Process flow and constraints**:
   - The process starts with receiving an order.
   - **Init(Receive order)**: The process must start with receiving an order.

3. **Order acceptance or rejection**:
   - After receiving the order, the sales department can either accept or reject the order.
   - **Exclusive-Choice(Accept order, Reject order)**: After receiving the order, either the order is accepted or rejected, but not both.

4. **Consequences of rejection**:
   - If the order is rejected, the process instance is finished.
   - **Not-Response(Reject order, Inform storehouse)**: If an order is rejected, the storehouse does not need to be informed.

5. **Consequences of acceptance**:
   - If the order is accepted, both the storehouse and engineering department are informed.
   - **Response(Accept order, Inform storehouse)**: Accepting the order leads to informing the storehouse.
   - **Response(Accept order, Inform engineering)**: Accepting the order also leads to informing the engineering department.

6. **Storehouse procedures**:
   - The storehouse processes the part list, checks availability, and either reserves or back-orders parts.
   - **Succession(Inform storehouse, Process part list)**: Informing the storehouse leads to processing the part list.
   - **Co-Existence(Reserve part, Back-order part)**: Both reserving and back-ordering parts can occur, but not necessarily together.

7. **Engineering department procedures**:
   - The engineering department prepares for assembly and then assembles the bicycle if all parts are available or back-ordered.
   - **Succession(Inform engineering, Prepare assembly)**: Informing the engineering department leads to preparing for assembly.
   - **Response(Process part list, Prepare assembly)**: Processing the part list leads to preparing for assembly.

8. **Assembly and shipping**:
   - **Succession(Prepare assembly, Assemble bicycle)**: Preparing for assembly leads to assembling the bicycle.
   - **Succession(Assemble bicycle, Ship bicycle)**: Assembling the bicycle leads to shipping it.

9. **Conditional execution based on part availability**:
   - Parts are either reserved or back-ordered, suggesting that for every part, one of these actions must happen.
   - **Exclusive-Choice(Reserve part, Back-order part)**: For each part, it is either reserved or back-ordered.

**Activities: Receive order, Accept order, Reject order, Inform storehouse, Inform engineering, Process part list, Reserve part, Back-order part, Prepare assembly, Assemble bicycle, Ship bicycle**

**Final Formal Declarative Constraints:**

1. Init(Receive order)
