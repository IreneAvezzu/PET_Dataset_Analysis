# PET_Dataset_Analysis

This repository constains the *code* and *prompts* used in the analysis of the phrases defined in the PET Dataset and the results of such analysis.

The original dataset (.parquet file) and a copy of it (.csv file) can be found in the **Data folder**.

In the **Result folder** can be found three different csv files containing the results, each one resulting from a different approach:
1. Analysis with *basic constraints* templates 
2. Analysis with *additional constraints* templates 
3. Analysis with *full constraints* and hirearchical rules (meta constraints).

The **Complete Interactions folder** contains the whole comand line interaction and LLM complete responses for each process description.
